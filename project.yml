developers_description: |
  The following is a list of developers who are involved in code that was found to be vulnerable. Specifically, developers end up here if they were the author of a commit to code that was, at some point in time, fixed for a vulnerability. Note that this is NOT a comprehensive list.

# A file name that ends with this string is considered to be source code
# The way I found these was to do this at the root of the git repo
#
# find -type f | cut -c 3- | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort | uniq > ~/django_exts.txt
#
# Then filtered by hand. Remove anything compressed, binary, dev-tools, etc.
