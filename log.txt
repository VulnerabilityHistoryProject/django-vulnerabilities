44bf371b25 Updated Argentinian spanish translation, 100% complete as of r10858.
d89ba464dd Changes to `ImageFileDescriptor` and `ImageField` to fix a few cases of setting image dimension fields.  * Moved dimension field update logic out of `ImageFileDescriptor.__set__` and into its own method on `ImageField`.  * New `ImageField.update_dimension_fields` method is attached to model instance's `post_init` signal so that:    * Dimension fields are set when defined before the ImageField.    * Dimension fields are set when the field is assigned in the model constructor (fixes #11196), but only if the dimension fields don't already have values, so we avoid updating the dimensions every time an object is loaded from the database (fixes #11084).  * Clear dimension fields when the ImageField is set to None, which also causes dimension fields to be cleared when `ImageFieldFile.delete()` is used.  * Added many more tests for ImageField that test edge cases we weren't testing before, and moved the ImageField tests out of `file_storage` and into their own module within `model_fields`.

5e58810e21 Applied latest changes to `ListMixin` from Aryeh Leib Taurog and added him to AUTHORS; fixed memory leak introduced in r10174 -- no longer call `ListMixin.__init__` and set methods manually because it created references that prevented garbage collection; fixed several routines that had no need to be class methods.
ae7cb577dd Refactored `get_srid_info` to use the ORM (now possible since it's no longer used in `GeometryField.__init__`), and moved to `fields` module; removed unnecessary code.

bb15cee58a Made a bunch of improvements to admin actions. Be warned: this includes one minor but BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE change.
d0c897d660 Made a set of small test changes to avoid leaving temp files hanging around after running the test suite. First, fixed a couple of places where temp dirs were (or could be) created without later being deleted. Second, added a missing close() before unlink() since Windows raises an error on an attempt to remove an open file.  Finally, in the file_uploads tests, avoided opening-by-name temporary files that we already have a descriptor for.  Doing additional opens seems to run afoul of the Windows issue with deleting open files, so it generally works better to just seek back to 0 instead of calling open multiple times.
6d5492630d Fixed a sloppy test auth test. [10400] revealed that the auth test was relying on the weird difference between calling a management from the shell and from `call_command`. That this worked in the first case was pretty much an accident.
dd966f081a Fixed the test case from [10399] to be more robust against the order in which test cases are executed.
8da2322cad Fixed #10080: `call_command` now takes option defaults into account, sparing individual commands from any difference between `call_command` and being run from the shell. Thanks, Alex Koshelev.

df7ffe616a Fixed #8900: Added errno=13 (permission denied) to the class of ignored OSErrors when attempting to delete the old file in file_move_safe.
63143d5d9d Fixed the test added for #9005 to use the e.args[0] instead of e.message. Exceptions didn't have 'message' before Python 2.5, and it was deprecated as of Python 2.6. args[0] works without error or DeprecationWarning from Python 2.3 through 2.6.
48e01d2b3d Fixed up the introspection code and tests added for #9779 to run under Python 2.3, which has neither set nor rsplit.
bb31cf37ff Replace test use of assertTrue with failUnless.  No matter how many times we try, Python 2.3 still doesn't recognize assertTrue.
668bc4f7be Fixed #10254: Changed the regex in get_valid_filename to allow unicode alphanumerics (thanks gulliver).  Also updated the file_uploads test for this case to check the name after saving the uploaded file. As it was the test ensured that files with unicode characters in their names could be uploaded, but it wasn't actually ensuring that the unicode characters were preserved through save.

624caace17 Fixed #9005: don't wig out when reversing a URL if SETTINGS_MODULE isn't set. While I was there, I fixed #10599 by re-raising the original error message, which is almost always a better idea. Thanks, Eric
dc832d7753 Fixed some silly assumptions about pk's that broke the test suite under postgresql.
b2645a15fd Reverted [10346] because it effectively breaks USE_I18N by forcing import of translation before settings are ready.
c4f7bf8312 Fixed #9847: mark the permission denied message for translation.
c860758a57 Fixed #8895: expose the debug setting to fastcgi. Thanks, paulegan.
a50c6f1f24 Fixed #10538: use a prefix for HTML ids on the admin doc page to avoid conflicts with existing elements. Thanks, Justin Lilly.

08056572e8 Fixed #9587. Formset.is_valid() now returns True if an invalid form is marked for deletion. Thanks for the test and intial patch, kratorius. Note that this leaves the form and formset errors alone. Those forms still have errors, it's just that it doesn't matter that they're invalid in the context of the formset and deletion. Also fixed #9665 while I was in there. Thanks, mark_hildreth.

9face54bb7 Fixed #9284. Fixed #8813. BaseModelFormSet now calls ModelForm.save(). This is backwards-incompatible if you were doing things to 'initial' in BaseModelFormSet.__init__, or if you relied on the internal _total_form_count or _initial_form_count attributes of BaseFormSet. Those attributes are now public methods.
1e082c3873 Fixed #10653 -- Update docs regarding Jython support.  Thanks, Leo Soto for ticket & patch.

Thanks to Alex for help in understanding how to fix this without un-doing the intent of r9766.

8f410a577b Fixed #10127 -- Corrected handling of select_related() in annotate() calls. Thanks to Sylvain Pasche <sylvain.pasche@gmail.com> for the report and test case.
65ad2132ab Fixed #10142 -- Added docs and an exploding error message to highlight an error present in the implementation of STDDEV_POP and VAR_POP in PostgreSQL 8.2-8.2.4 that will give incorrect answers (the database function mistakenly returns sample, rather than population deviation/variance). Thanks to Vinay Sajip <vinay_sajip@yahoo.co.uk> for the report, and Ian Kelly for pointing out the cause of the problem.
2b8e768b22 Fixed #9858 -- Added ability to use PostGIS template with GIS test runner via `POSTGIS_TEMPLATE` setting.  Thanks to Aryeh Leib Taurog for feature suggestion and initial patch.

15b1675af9 Fixed #10113 -- Ensured that joined fields mentioned in order_by() are included in the GROUP_BY clause on those backends that require it. Thanks to Koen Biermans <koen.biermans@werk.belgie.be> for the report.
f5ed27cf1f Fixed #10052 -- Added import line for other aggregates used in examples. Thanks to Tyler Brownell <tyler@bluefoxstudio.ca> for the suggestion.

9c6efb2eea Fixed #9789 -- Handle jython's compiled settings filename correctly. Patch from Frank Wierzbicki.
dd2e1356f0 Corrected code in serializers_regress testcase so that, in the case where an exception has been raised, rollback is called before attempting to leave transaction management.  With the old code the original exception (IntegrityError on InnoDB) was getting hidden by a transaction management error resulting from attempting to leave transaction management with a pending commit/rollback.
81dfd1f5f0 Fixed #8055: Replaced use of traceback.format_exc (new in Python 2.4) with something that works as far back as 2.3.
3c87c22b3c Added code to make TestSuites iterable when running on Python 2.3.  (r9756 added code that iterates over them, thus broke running tests on Python 2.3, sigh.)
b41a45f8e5 Fixed #5543: callproc() and friends now work with Oracle and our FormatStylePlaceholderCursor.
6332ad4804 Fixed #10044: You can now assign directly to file fields (`instance.filefield = somefile`). Thanks, Marty Alchin.
79138a6106 Fixed #10041: use a tempdir for files in the forms test. Thanks, Marty Alchin.
b120c74032 Changed "date" column to "start_date"--Oracle won't name columns with reserved keywords.

1c1425130d Fixed #6767: corrected a 2.3 compatibility issue in [9750]. Thanks to tlow.

344f16e220 Fixed #8138 -- Changed django.test.TestCase to rollback tests (when the database supports it) instead of flushing and reloading the database.   This can substantially reduce the time it takes to run large test suites.
f9f9d703cf Fixed #10042 -- YAADT (Aggregation Docs Typo).
b3dd0b5dcc Fixed #10039 -- More typos in aggregation docs. Seriously, people, now you're just making me look bad :-) Thanks to ElliottM, and to Erich Holscher for a separate report that I've piggybacked on this checkin.

14d15093bc Corrected typo in aggregation docs. Thanks to Ivan Sagalaev for the report.
3937de4e24 Removed an redundant import from the Oracle backend. Thanks to Ramiro Morales for the report.

ffeb1d0465 Fixed #9346: fixed comment upgrade SQL in documentation. Thanks, mt.
3990d00f20 Fixed #9959: fixed comment documentation example showing how to get a preview.
4035ea3538 A few small fixes to django.contrib.comments (Comment.get_as_text for non-authenticated users; references to Comment.permalink; unused imports). Fixes #9143, #9429, and 9439. Thanks, Thejaswi Puthraya.
11d382c6c4 Fixed a long line, a typo, and a few misspellings from [9727].
c01098e9cb In urlconfs, include() may now be used on an iterable of patterns instead of just a module string. Refs #6470 -- making the admin use a urlconf is much easier with this work done. Thanks, Alex Gaynor.
299e1e814f Fixed #6791: added a write-through cache session backend: session data is written through the cache to the database, but read from the cache for speed. Thanks to jhenry, mcroydon, and jdunck.
d32c290846 Revised r9566 slightly to be backwards compatible with versions 1.0 - 1.0.2.
0e59fbbd85 Updated Polish translation: fixed typo and one missing translation

d068ad0c01 Using querysets as an rvalue in filter() calls was causing an unnecessary database query, due to a bool() call. This change stops that behaviour.
d00c013cc8 Remove any ordering from a nested select query (in the where-clause).
c20019a91d Fixed #9972: The dbshell command was ignoring the DATABASE_HOST and DATABASE_PORT settings in Oracle.
300752bd6c Return None for null date/time fields in OGR-supported data sources.  Thanks to Ariel Mauricio Nunez Gomez for bug report and initial patch.
bde7e79fb3 Refs #9935: Added a note in the documentation to the effect that Django currently requires a 4.X release of cx_Oracle.

3cd1e80ae4 Fixed `check_geom` and `check_srs` to accept larger sized pointer addresses as returned by some platforms (including OpenBSD 4.4 and Fedora 8).
a754165a91 Fixed #9637: Use 'block.super' in admin 'extrastyle' blocks to preserve changes in base_site.html
50cd258a24 Fixed #9664 -- `LayerMapping` now works with MySQL spatial backends.
d39540af92 Fixed #9892 -- support additional binary packages for GEOS & GDAL libs on OSX & Ubuntu platforms.
89dc5b894a Added some documentation explaining (1) that it's possible to add users via the Django admin site, and (2) that in order to be able to add users via the admin site, you need to have both 'add user' and 'change user' permissions. Refs #9866
be2697209b Improved the auth admin site to raise Http404 with a helpful error message if DEBUG is True, explaining why permission isn't denied. Refs #9866, and see also [9682]
62362c6175 Added comment to UserAdmin.add_view() explaining why we disallow users without change permissions from adding other users. Refs #9866
9af56803f5 Fixed #8245 -- Added a LOADING flag to autodiscover to prevent an admin.py module with errors from raising a spurious AlreadyRegistered exception in a subsequent call to autodiscover.

ca33f07e2c Fixed #9865 -- Allow saving of new inline-edited objects with custom non-auto primary key fields that are not the foreign key to the parent object.
04ed423469 Fixed #9898 -- Added a missing 'e' to 'one'.  Thanks gizzywump.  Also Americanized specialised while in the area, per contributing's guideline.
dc4c95cdbf Fixed a typo in r9650.
986e162c5d Follow-up to r9656 -- beef up the added test to exercise all (one can hope) paths through the troublesome get_deleted_objects function and fix the resulting errors.
10894da8a8 Fixed #9859 -- Added another missing force_unicode needed in admin when running on Python 2.3.  Many thanks for report & patch to nfg.
5f78eff909 Fixed #9814 -- Allowed SafeStrings to be saved to sqlite DB when running on Python 2.6.
b58a260c56 Fixed #9431 -- Added extra validation for VARCHAR-based fields on MySQL. max_length > 255 and unique=True is not permitted. Based on a patch from adamnelson.
fddc0c589e Removed one test that is only intended for PostgreSQL from the visibility of other databases. This basically hides an annoying warning when running the tests under MySQL.
b96b450981 Fixed #9786 -- Fixed inequality checking for django.db.models.fields.file.FieldFile class.
4bede45816 Remove some code in loaddata that bails out of searching for fixture files (only when verbosity > 1) as soon as attempting to open any potential fixture file fails. This code looks to have been mistakenly added in r9527; loaddata ought to proceed with attempting to locate other fixture files, regardless of verbosity setting, as it did before r9527.
5257fd2225 Reformatted PL/SQL flush left so "manage.py sqlall [app] | manage.py dbshell" works with Oracle.  Also some PEP8 cleanup.
f1f1d366c8 Removed django.db.models.options.Options.one_to_one_field.
bb6d5dc69b Fixed #9795: Since related-object selection widgets take limit_choices_to into account, the offending code is no longer necessary and can simply be removed.
a1cbeb9afb If an SQL query doesn't specify any ordering, avoid the implicit sort that happens with MySQL when a "GROUP BY" clause is included. This is a backend-specific operation, so any other databases requiring similar encouragement can have a function added to their own backend code.
7030ab9a72 Yet another place where we claim to support 2.3 and up
280236eacd Another place where we talked about Python versions.
626f72733d Clarify install docs to point at new FAQ items about Python 3.0.

80da07e4b9 The "permanent" parameter to redirect_to (r9594) is new in Django 1.1. Noted as much in the docs.
731f6be262 Fixed #9777 -- Typo fix.
d29b7a14c5 Fixed #9772 -- Fixed a couple of broken links and pointed them to a more appropriate section. Thanks, Ramiro Morales.

5e9c5de78a Fixed #9775 -- Fixed an oversight from r9601 and allow direct attribute lookup in the serializable_value() method. This means that abstract parents that are multi-table children of other models(no, really!!) now work again.
c006ef5746 Did some much-needed rewriting/editing in the formsets section of docs/topics/forms/modelsforms.txt. 'It self' is not two words.
6553ddc5b4 Improved the model formset and inline formset documentation to be more explicit and handle some cases that were never addressed before.
15bd649940 Fixed obscure Oracle quoting issues pointed out by the custom_columns_regress test case.

6590c0bcf5 Fixed #9747 -- now explicitly set response type on C functions that return WKB and WKT.
662e12b45c The second part of fixing "related inherited models" display. Handle raw_id values for child models in the admin. Fixed #9461.
d662ef5540 The first step in fixing a group of problems related to outputting a proper "value" for a field that is a relation to another model.
fa7aa7255c Fixed #9732 -- Added missing close paragraph tag to password reset confirmation template, thanks casseen.
235600c3c3 Fixed #9724 -- Added missing import to URLconf example, thanks shacker.
ff3e1a7d40 Fixed #9718 -- Removed a reference to oldforms FormWrapper object in the user authentication docs.
b76d7c1dec Added a 'permanent' argument the simple.redirect_to() generic view. It's True by default, to match existing behavior. If set to False, the redirect will be a 302 instead of a 301. This is technically backwards-incompatible if you were using the redirect_to generic view with a format-string key called 'permanent', which is highly, highly unlikely.
e9b90d9899 Edited ref/contrib/csrf.txt changes from [9554]
352efd1893 Edited docs/topics/forms/index.txt changes from [9569] and fixed a typo in the visible_fields() docstring

9a4f1760fd Added svn:ignore properties on some recently added directories
5834b1837f Fixed #9736 -- Added quoting to the SQL constraint names generated during table creation. This is to accommodate primary keys with spaces.
87fc7efda5 Added a note to the SQLite database documentation mentioning that version 3.6.2 is to be avoided like the plague. Fortunately, it was only the latest release for three weeks, so avoidance is easy (as is upgrading).

81c8b3c696 Clean up the imports in loaddata.py to match other code whilst I'm in the neighbourhood.

bd2b0059be Here's the rest of [9530] where I actually rename the tag like I said I did. I swear this was git's fault, not mine.
714490ba51 Fixed a bug introduced by [9527] -- empty/invalid fixtures were no longer being reported.
4aa97f5c18 Fixed #6398: added an optional `{% empty %}` clause to the `{% for %}` template tag. The contents of this clause are rendered if the list iterated over turns out to be empty. Thanks, Jannis Leidel.
136c4f8549 Fixed a small reST header glitch in docs/ref/templates/builtins.txt
f4879af2df Fixed a bug introduced by [9527] -- empty/invalid fixtures were no longer being reported.

150a598d0c Fixed #9617 -- Fixed a typo in the Polish translation. Thanks, romke.
e7430816bc Fixed #8612 -- Bug-fxing Danish translation update.  Same patch as r9491 on 1.0.X branch.
3ba235a348 OneToOne filtering should only apply in a popup selection from the related model.
e5437af89a Forward-port docutils fix from [9497].
5759f28947 Add 1.0.2 release notes to trunk so they show up online

21e86f2af2 Updated stylesheet link on the change password form.
902df97f36 Removed the hidden import rules in the contrib.admin stylesheets. Each individual stylesheet is now linked to explicitly from the template where it's used (in the extrastyle block), with the exception of widgets.css, which is imported by forms.css, but still available separately for reuse. Also moved the override stylesheets (IE and RTL) below the extrastyle block and all styles within the conditional comment which blocks CSS from IE5 and lower.

bca14cd3c8 Fixed #9076 -- Changed BaseInlineFormSet to not override BaseModelFormSet's get_queryset method.  BaseInlineFormSet's method did not include a couple of fixes/enhancements that were made to the parent's method, resulting in excessive queries (some of which can return bad data due to #9006) for admin pages with inlines.

e47cc781d8 A bug from queryset-refactor days: although the Query class has "group_by" and "having" attributes, only the former was included in the resulting SQL, meaning subclasses had to completely duplicate Query.as_sql() if they were using any kind of grouping filtering on the results.

399abd7fe8 Changed the reverse() call for creating URLs to convert a "." in the reg-exp pattern to a "." in the final output. This hides what is probably a bug in the pattern (the user almost certainly should have written "\."), but it will avoid a large number of "bug" reports about reverse().

e545058ba9 Fixed #8354: the MySQL backend no longer raises a cryptic error. Instead, it raises a less-cryptic error. Obiously this isn't a perfect solution by any means, but it'll do until we can revisit timezone handling in the future.
15206298ed Revert [8799]. That wasn't ready for prime-time yet -- thanks, git-svn!
a3196dac48 Make sure to use force_unicode when looking up comment objects by `object_pk`. Fixes #8762, and one other bug that nobody's reported yet.

4480645ac3 Fixed #8316 -- Put tighter restrictions on the type of Foreign Key fields created for MySQL (because MySQL + InnoDB has those restrictions). Patch from julianb.

3b63953704 Fixed #6967: `ModelForm`s now validate choices. Thanks, mattmcc -- the failing test helped quite a bit.
4ae746b574 Added a `TypedChoiceField` which acts just like `ChoiceField`, except that it returns a value coerced by some provided function. Refs #6967.

e1ea7014ad Fixed #8725 -- Handle empty URL patterns in reverse().
30c7ce90c5 Fixed #8631 -- Corrected a display issue with the popup submit_row where the Save button would overflow. Thanks btaylordesign for report and initial patch.
24bacb19de Fixed #5216 -- Fixed a case of a string not being a unicode string. Thanks to Vadim Fint for the test case.

f2d7ee759a Fixed #8710: removed a few stray tabs. Thanks, gkelly.
ddaa3016e2 Last missing string translated in Polish locale.
395cd3b42c Accidentally committed a rebase of the Macedonian messages in [8742] (this wasn't a translation update). Undoing that. My fault entirely.

c0b53b3dcc Removed the need for ROOT_URLCONF in settings when running Django's core tests (via runtests.py). It was embarrassing having to explain the need for it to people, since we ignore whatever setting is passed in.
fd0cc45828 [8721] introduced some internal field names. We hide them from the list of valid field names in debugging output so that it doesn't confuse things.
c60e22c073 Fixed #8699 -- Updated Hungarian translation from Szilveszter Farkas.
cc971910a9 Changed [8727] to use ImportError, which seems to actually work. Not sure what I was smoking when I tested this 10 minutes ago. Refs #8680. Thanks to gkelly for cleaning up after me.
4184d6348e Fixed #8680 -- Changed a couple of GEOExceptions to Python's RuntimeError so that help() works. Without this change, even if you didn't use the gis stuff, just using Python 2.5's help() system would crash when searching for model names.
b2dd9c6fa1 Fixed a few of the msgid (untranslated strings) encodings in the French translation. Not sure why they weren't properly UTF-8 encoded originally.
fb041b1620 Another French update from David Larlet. Fixed #8661.

c068bc184c Merge branch 'url-tag-asvar'
2ca8cf3628 Fixed #8653: make formtools' security hash more rubust. Silly that I didn't think of this before; thanks to bthomas for providing the obvious fix.
71076ae299 Fixed some edge-case error handling from [8699]. Thanks, gkelly.
ef7f61a35e Fixed #8541 -- An attempt at translating the technical messages IDs for zh_CN from garcia_marc. This fixes the obvious problem, but a full translation update is needed from a Chinese speaker here.

8f0bdb1468 Fixed #8685 -- Updated Portugese translation from Nuno Mariz.

3717e3bba3 Reverted #8688 for now, since it merely introduced different bugs, rather than fixing the problem. We have a plan B (and plan C, if needed), so this will be fixed in a different way.
c113133dad Fixed #7893 -- Gave `fieldsets` dictionary options a better visual display to set aside from other options in the ModelAdmin due to some name clashing causing confusion.
6a8dcafb57 Fixed #8278: fixed `QueryDict.update(QueryDict)`. Thanks, julien.
cd0b65bcf7 Fixed #7982 -- Corrected ModelAdmin url dispatching to ensure it matching exactly what it needs and doesn't stomp on primary key space. 'add' is a lost cause for now. This originated from #6470. Thanks jdetaeye for the original patch and basith for providing test cases.
ddf7d7ab02 Fixed #8668: prevent MySQL from running the new test from [8676].
8cfecbd748 Italian translation, again: darned KBabel...
d95466b7a0 Italian translation updated (apparently, even string freezes are subject to global warming, lately...)

e66b0ae576 Updated Japanese translation from Takashi Matsuo.
90279aeaf0 Fixed #8575 -- Catch one particular instance of OperationalError in MySQL and convert it to an IntegrityError, which seems like the more natural case (and is consistent with other backends). This makes exception handling in Django much easier.
54f41e3507 Fixed #8101 -- Allow the strings '1' and '0' as filter values for boolean fields (the latter was causing problems). This allows these values in URLs (e.g. the admin filtering).
a1d2f6ef0c Fixed #7823 -- Fixed an edge case in RelatedField.get_db_prep_lookup() so that it works correctly with custom field subclasses. Patch from Ivan Sagalaev.
d22ee35ee9 Fixed #8662 -- Fixed the documentation of Model.save() to match the real signature so that people overriding it will use the right signature.

195420259a Fixed #8403 -- Changed the use of fcntl.flock() to fcntl.lockf(). On some systems, this will ensure fnctl-based file locking is always used, which means locking of NFS-mounted files should work.
f96b1249ce Removed a couple of unused imports.
65c0846c45 Updated a few save() methods on models to accept force_insert and force_update parameters. Required as a consequence of [8670] (so they can be used with create()).

229f2c1ca0 Fixed #8636: Corrected the test client to use the string '80' in the request META, rather than the integer 80. Thanks to Adam Lofts for the report and fix.

a0dd9ecdd8 Fixed #8624, Updated Hungarian translation, Thanks Szilveszter Farkas.
21672c26bf Fixed #8592 -- Fixed a bug in the way savepoint usage was disabled for PostgreSQL < 8.0.
59607bb1c1 Italian translation: no real string changes, just run makemessages again to shorten long lines (compilemessages too, for completeness)
71dda19184 Fixed #8597 -- Allow the use of strings containing underscores and percentage signs in "iexact" queries on PostgreSQL again (this case was missed in [8536]).
f749b84824 Fixed #8625 -- Updated Hebrew translation from Meir Kriheli.
4cd03ef5d9 Improvements to [8608] to fix an infinite loop (for exclude(generic_relation)). Also comes with approximately 67% less stupidity in the table joins for filtering on generic relations.

08024e9503 Fixed #8601: a small typo in comment views.
1106c558b1 Fixed #8544: correctly cast `Comment.object_pk` to string when doing lookups. This really only papers over a bigger problem related to casting the RHS of GFKs, but that larger change can wait for a more systematic fix.
ff420b4364 Fixed #8454: added a FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS setting to control the permissoin of files uploaded by the built-in file storage system. Thanks, dcwatson.
f58217cc02 Fixed #8455: a lack of permissions in `MEDIA_ROOT` no longer causes an infinite loop when saving files. Thanks, carljm.
52672f2b94 Fixed #8534: getting the size of a file no longer opens it (at least for the built-in file-system storage). Thanks, snaury.
8943a857a7 Fixed #8175: don't open files we're about to close. This was a pesky bug to track down; thanks to charmless for tracking it down.
c33aeaa082 FIxed #8156: `UploadedFile.__repr__` now returns a string, a good `__repr__` should.
40e5cde1c5 Fixed #7379: fixed a subtle corner case involving URL encoding in `CommonMiddleware`
615ed20006 Fixed #7769: Added a couple missing file methods to `TemporaryUploadedFile`. Thanks, Mads Sülau Jørgensen.

ee28560997 Fixed #8311 -- Avoid an infinite loop with session key generation when using the cache backend and memcached goes away (or is not running).
b80db03ca7 Italian translation updated, a few strings improved. Thanks to Nicola Murino for the original patch.
7e9a22aae7 Fixed #7289 -- Made ModelForms behave like Forms in the sense that Field objects don't appear as attributes on the final form instance. They continue to appear as elements of the form_instance.fields mapping.
ec8848dad5 Fixed #8589 -- Fixed the URL for the logout link on the app_index page in admin.
c2ba59fc1d Removed oldforms, validators, and related code:  * Removed `Manipulator`, `AutomaticManipulator`, and related classes.  * Removed oldforms specific bits from model fields:    * Removed `validator_list` and `core` arguments from constructors.    * Removed the methods:      * `get_manipulator_field_names`      * `get_manipulator_field_objs`      * `get_manipulator_fields`      * `get_manipulator_new_data`      * `prepare_field_objs_and_params`      * `get_follow`    * Renamed `flatten_data` method to `value_to_string` for better alignment with its use by the serialization framework, which was the only remaining code using `flatten_data`.  * Removed oldforms methods from `django.db.models.Options` class: `get_followed_related_objects`, `get_data_holders`, `get_follow`, and `has_field_type`.  * Removed oldforms-admin specific options from `django.db.models.fields.related` classes: `num_in_admin`, `min_num_in_admin`, `max_num_in_admin`, `num_extra_on_change`, and `edit_inline`.  * Serialization framework    * `Serializer.get_string_value` now calls the model fields' renamed `value_to_string` methods.    * Removed a special-casing of `models.DateTimeField` in `core.serializers.base.Serializer.get_string_value` that's handled by `django.db.models.fields.DateTimeField.value_to_string`.  * Removed `django.core.validators`:    * Moved `ValidationError` exception to `django.core.exceptions`.    * For the couple places that were using validators, brought over the necessary code to maintain the same functionality.  * Introduced a SlugField form field for validation and to compliment the SlugField model field (refs #8040).  * Removed an oldforms-style model creation hack (refs #2160).
a157576660 Updated Polish translation to match new comments system
c305471610 Fixed get_absolute_url() for comments. Previously, it relied on "view on site" for admin being reversible or required people to set up their own version. Now we ship a default pattern in the comments URLs in a way that is unlikely to clash with anything else.
157dbe2fff Fixed #8552 -- Use the LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL setting in the auth tests, rather than hard-coding the value.
9de848cec9 Fixed #8544 -- Some more documentation markup fixes from Thejawsi Puthraya.

8226b8c957 Fixed #8569 -- Ensure that apps are correctly set up before introspecting them in admin validation.
255bf69e09 Tweaked the admin validation code to make things a bit easier to read. Tracing through all the underscore-prefixed and wrapped functions was a bit trying and some of the names were misleading. No functional changes. Primarily, this is just bringing the style into line with the rest of the codebase.
70966cb9c7 Fixed #6893: `FormWizard` now properly updates its `step` value. Thanks, siddhi and wamberg.

6056ab1bee Fixed #6209: handle `BooleanField`s in `FormPreview` and `FormWizard`. In the process, broke the the security hash calculation out to a helper function. Thanks to mcroydon and rajeshdhawan.

c5cc26ff99 Fixed some Sphinx markup in signals docs.
6f29ad31b5 Fixed #8326: added signals documentation.
378f5ddb5a Updated comment signals to provide enough information to actually act on. This was uncovered when working on the documentation, which'll be committed shortly.
c6a2bd9b96 Fixed #6353 (again) by making force_unicode() and smart_str() a bit more robust in the face of funky Exception instances. This is slightly symptomatic of problems in the calling code, but we don't want to raise a secondary exception whilst trying to display the first one. Based on a patch from Karen Tracey.
5dd68fa74a Marked a couple of unmarked strings in edit_inline templates and corrected a marked string.
5a72589d7a Fixed #7984 -- 'View on site' links now work in inlines. Thanks philwo for the report and initial patch by julianb.
05a4439581 Fixed #8560 -- Corrected a typo in a comment of docs/intro/tutorial02.txt to be consistent with the change in [8432]. Thanks ramiro for catching this.
c849fcc66d Fixed #8558 -- Removed a stray line in tutorial 2 left over from when it was rewritten for the new admin.
a516ebdff1 Fixed #8126: improved `admin.autodiscover()` to be more forgiving of invalid `INSTALLED_APPS` entries and/or exotic import schemes that don't have `__path__`.
30de7331d4 Fixed #8326: added documentation about running Django on Jython. Docs originally written by Leo Soto, and then cleaned up a bit by me.
c5c61b261e Fixed #8555: corrected `get_comment_form` tag documentation.
4f711eb5e3 Fixed #8347 -- Added a few missing field type conversion to SQLite's inspectdb handling. Patch from trbs.
3111d7f60b Fixed #7201 -- Fixed the timeuntil filter to work correctly with timezone-aware times. Patch from Jeremy Carbaugh.
61957df17f Added a few people to the AUTHORS file who have made recent contributions.
8c4a525871 Fixed #7177 -- Added extra robustness to the escapejs filter so that all invalid characters are correctly escaped. This avoids any chance to inject raw HTML inside <script> tags. Thanks to Mike Wiacek for the patch and Collin Grady for the tests.
fcf059d539 Fixed #7084 -- Fixed the "makemessages" command to handle line endings correctly on Windows (previous behaviour was to explode when encountering a multi-line messages). Patch and testing from Ramiro Morales.
73afcee6ed Fixed #6101 -- Tweaked a couple of places in the delete-related-objects collection for the admin so that auto-escaping can do the right thing: not too many times, not too few. Thanks to Karen Tracey for debugging most of this.
af83b650be Fixed #8150 -- Updated a reference to creating an admin class in the overview document. Based on a patch from mk.
ccb37ce74c The comments app was unconditionally accessing various settings that didn't exist in Django's global settings. Changed those accesses to conditional lookups with default fallbacks.
47ed499a5d Corrected references that aren't `Field` attributes.
b016ea0ace Removed trailing whitespace in a few files.
15ed5e61c9 Hid a few QuerySet regression tests from Python 2.6 due to a bug in the the Python beta releases. Failures there mean that incorrect code won't raise an error, but it's otherwise harmless (correct code still runs correctly).
948a833eb7 Fixed #8490 -- Worked around a bug in flup 1.0.1 when working out the correct path_info setting in the WSGI handler. Thanks, Mike Richardson.
f2b389b354 Added documentation to explain the gains and losses when using utf8_bin collation in MySQL. This should help people to make a reasonably informed decision. Usually, leaving the MySQL collation alone will be the best solution, but if you must change it, this gives a start to the information you need and pointers to the appropriate place in the MySQL docs.
b2c2c3a2ed A few fixes for the testing documentation:  * Removed an extra semicolon that was preventing the rendering of a Sphinx class directive for the `Client()` class.  * Indented `Client` class's methods.  * Added linebreaks after attribute directives of `Response` class so Sphinx rendenders them correctly.  * Removed trailing whitespace.
5485e0d97f Fixes for Geo sitemap errata.
8a88379b2a Fixed the `GeometryField` form to catch more than just GEOS exceptions.
b47c25ef91 Removed a stray reference to mysql_old in the docs.
d5f1d6f937 Fixed #8542 -- Made the model_formstests tests from [8528] a little less dependent upon the precise values of auto-created primary key integers.
4df380ff01 Fixed #8543: added translation markings to can_delete and can_order form labels. Thanks, msaelices.
6a5cc9e7f6 Fixed #7831: be case-insensitive when in `get_language_from_request`.
ddb3cdd514 Fixed #6353: better handle unicode in exception reasons.
3deff41a32 Fixed #8106 -- Untangled some problems with complex select_related() queries and models that have multiple paths to them from other models.
6abe0460c8 Fixed a silly typo in comment settings doc.
cba91997a2 Refactored Django's comment system.
b46e736c9a Because the filter tests take non-zero time to pass, it's possible for one of the timeuntil tests to fail because the pre-recorded "now" has moved on sufficiently far from actual "now()". Fixed the one test that was failing for me (the other timeuntil and timesince tests already have a small buffer built in to guard against this problem).
853f4d29b8 Fixed #8547 -- Corrected the breadcrumb display in the object_history.html template. Thanks sorl for catching this.
834ce902c2 Fixed #8499 -- Corrected a couple of instances of where the CSS class name error should be errors. Thanks rmyers for catching this.

cbd574881c Updated `TimeInput` changes from [8491] to allow time widgets to be used with unicode values. Fixes #7499.
7e06b69a3d Removed outdated "adminindex" command -- the same behavior is now far easier and better done in a template, or perhaps a custom `AdminSite.index` function. Refs #5500.
ab7eabfcd1 Fixed #8519: report the correct class in databrowse's `AlreadyRegistered` error. Thanks, mattmcc.
0a6314f249 Fixed #8285: signal handlers that aren't functions work under DEBUG. This slightly loosens the sanity check, but things that are valid under production shouldn't fail under debug.
1aa4889808 Fixed get_or_create test case for Oracle by re-raising the more specific IntegrityError for "ORA-01400: Cannot insert NULL into [table.col]"
78d13fb1c2 Fixed #8379: the admin user change form now properly validates the username. Thanks, kratorius.
9a1e4cedde Fixed #8344: make User.get_profile() work when settings.AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE is unset.

06d49768bd Fixed #7743: Reverted [8483], which was itself a reversion of [8481], after confirmation from Malcolm. Corrected a long standing mistake in the timesince/timeuntil filters when using a parameter for 'now'. Thanks to Andrew Shearer <ashearerw@shearersoftware.com> for the report.
78bdff1adc Fixed #8517 - updated Polish translations. Thanks, Piotr Lewandowski.
c46bb219bf Fixed #7460 -- Made the "cache" template tag always generate keys that can be used with the memcache backend (which has the strongest restriction on keys). Based on a patch from trbs.
29d2160213 Fixed #7464 -- Fixed the psycopg2 backend to handle SafeString values as parameters. Based on a patch from Digitalxero@gmail.com.
62b39322f3 Fixed #7496 -- It's now possible to pickle SortedDicts with pickle protocol 2 (used in caching). Thanks, John Huddleston.
d62cfce213 Improved the regression test in [8460] a bit, based on some information from John Huddleston in #7496.
de977c8514 Fixed #8522 -- Allow app_index to take extra_context to be consistent with the other views in the admin. Thanks Jannis Leidel for the patch.
82a1d5471c Fixed #7888 -- Handle model inheritance with model formsets correctly. Thanks bpeschier for the report.
05e8c3ecd3 Fixed #8491 -- Allow settings.LOCALE_PATH to be any sequence, not just a tuple.
d535edb9da Fixed #8510 -- Allow both strings (mostly for the admin) and integers to be used in "month" and "day" filters on date/datetime fields. Without this commit, SQLite behaved inconsistently after [8494].
6d6fb392b4 Fixed #7195 -- Fixed the validation of MultipleChoice fields so that they can be populated from request.REQUEST. Based on a patch from Daniel Roseman.
d6e5632969 Added Kevin McConnell to AUTHORS (fixed #8524). Also turned Julia Elman into a real person.
072083f261 Fixed #8520 -- Corrected a dumb typo in the call to password_change in django/contrib/admin/sites.py. Thanks Karen Tracey for catching this.
6b5a607606 Fixed #7628 -- Oracle backend won't try to recreate existing sequences during syncdb.  Thanks, cmarshal.
fbf09ee11d Added a test to show that [8472] also fixed #8254.
1ab16c7302 Fixed #7243: Corrected some example code in the custom model fields documentation. Thanks to Norman Harman for the fix.
ac858a2a61 Fixed #7996: Added a note that you need to register your site with Google in order for the ping_google command to work. Thanks to Jason Broyles (issya) for the suggestion.
27371e3286 Fixed #8486: Corrected some file attribute names in the request/response docs. Thanks to mrsanders for the report.
78c2c95ed3 Fixed #8129: Modified the password reset email template to use a URL lookup, so that the email doesn't require customization based on the way that the reset view is deployed. Thanks to davenaff for the report and fix.
57b9061d12 Added svn:ignore to recently added directory.
11e43883d5 Fixed #8298: Added a to_python method for integer fields. This ensures that the data from deserialized instances is of correct type prior to saving. Thanks to Andrew Badr for the report.

74b3173fba Fixed #8511: Removed some tests that were failing on Python 2.4, but weren't really contributing anything anyway. Thanks to jarrow for the report.
213f294638 Avoid a crash when unencoding session data for the db backend. This is required because some configurations of MySQL (with utf8_bin collation) will return bytestring, rather than unicode data, which was causing problems previously.
97cb07c3a1 Massive reorganization of the docs. See the new docs online at http://docs.djangoproject.com/.
b3688e8194 Fixed #7903 -- Allow admin's prepopulated_from to work with TextFields. Patch from mk and Alex Gaynor.
aa78a05e69 Fixed #8359 -- Add an admin log entry when creating a new user. Patch from evan_schulz.
712bb0dde7 Fixed KML sitemaps, and added support for generating KMZ and GeoRSS sitemaps; sitemaps now support Google's Geo Sitemap format.
c83a96d298 Tweaked the Admin add/change page so that "save" is still the highlighted too look like the default button and it actually operates as the defaut (previously "save and add another" was the default action, which confused people if you hit the save button and it looked like your work was eaten by a grue).
7eb4b30d6f Updated German translation
aba518f0f8 Removed a relatively pointless QuerySet clone introduced in [8472].
1ec12576f3 Fixed #8495 -- Updated Hebrew translation. Thanks, mksoft.
abb1c508cc Tests for password change process. Thanks, Mike Richardson. Fixed #8402.
cc95b44547 Updated password change template (in admin templates) to use current form variables (rather than oldforms stuff). Patch from Mike Richardson. Refs #8402.
77bf14d581 Fixed #8259 -- Handle an error situation that we should never see, but still occurs for some reason (be liberal in what you accept, and all that). Patch from kevin.
64ca36bf08 Fixed #8214 -- Added back a stringification that was dropped during [8131]. This restores filtering on dates in the admin, for example. Thanks to akfarrell and a small team of workers at the Portland Sprint.
a9f0ae706a Fixed #8203 -- Fixed temporary file deleation on Windows and a couple of edge cases on Unix-like systems. Patch from snaury. Testing and verification on Windows, Mac and Linux from cgrady and ramikassab.
eaa64cd889 Small edit of [8491].
8a3ef1f8bc Fixed #7499 -- Trim microseconds off rendering of form.TimeFields by default so that they validate. Previous code didn't work with microseconds anyway, so this is backwards compatible. Thanks to kevin for the patch.
646f2f6101 Fixed #7494 -- Fixed build_absolute_url() for some types of (uncommon) URLs. Patch from tom@almostobsolete.net and RobotAdam.
3dd69a965b Fixed #7244 -- Allow widget overriding in subclasses for ModelChoiceField, ModelMultipleChoiceField and FilePathField. Patch from Sebastian Noack and Colin Grady.
943c28a4c6 Fixed #7042 -- The management validation command nows alerts users to the presence (and incorrectness) of unique=True on ManyToManyFields. This has never worked and generates invalid SQL. Now it's raised as an explicit error during validation. Thanks to clamothe for the patch.
0511435a33 Fixed #8498 -- Add the ability to customize the template for app_index similar to the other views on the AdminSite class. Thanks Jannis Leidel for the patch.
67402a6fb5 Reverted [8481] and [8482] while we work out what is going on with #8453 and the related discussions that I wasn't previously aware of.
358ba07166 Fixed #7946: Modified object history template to use a common date format. Thanks to Marc Garcia for the report and patch.
a9ee1d4e28 Fixed #7776: Ensured that the test cookie is always deleted once a login has succeeded. Thanks for the report and fix, Mnewman.
0f869f905e Fixed #7747: Altered EmailMessage such that messages with long subject lines don't use tabs in their continutation sequence. Tabs in subjects cause problems with Outlook and Thunderbird. Thanks to Mark Allison <mark.allison@maplecroft.com> for the report and fix.
b35acb3ee9 Corrected a test case error mistakenly committed in [8481].
46da8ac9e5 Fixed #7443: Corrected a long standing mistake in the timesince/timeuntil filters when using a parameter for 'now'. Thanks to Andrew Shearer <ashearerw@shearersoftware.com> for the report.
a0e87b771b Fixed #8465. Mark KML input as safe so elements aren't escaped; added some defaults for name and description.
58c579b005 Fixed #8367 -- Pass the object to get_form from get_fieldsets in ModelAdmin. Thanks jarrow for catching this.
324befc477 Fixed #8388: Corrected documentation for SortedDict use in extra()

a64dc39fb7 Fixed #7602 -- Corrected lookup keyword arguments in archive_month and archive_week to properly range when date_field is from DateField. Thanks nullie for the original patch and Colin Grady for the test coverage.
264771f1b6 Fixed #7536 -- Added NEWDECIMAL to introspection types in the mysql backend. Thanks Jerome Etienne for the patch.
77c78201b8 Fixed #1390 -- Added an app index in the admin interface. Thanks juliae and ext for their work on patches.
ab26efc952 Fixed #8493 -- Fixed a NoReverseMatch when redirecting to password_change/done/ in the admin. Added the ability to override redirects to other password change views for consistency. Thanks for the report mtrichardson.
d4d7bc175d Fixed #8046 -- The first filter() call on a related manager for many-to-many fields no longer creates duplicate copies of the join table(s). Basically, this means filters on the join table (for ManyToManyField(through=...)) and complex filters in the normal (non-through) case don't produce incorrect or duplicate results.
6e36ce1429 Fixed Oracle backend limit/offset SQL to again use extra_select, properly this time.  This cleans up a test case failure, and hopefully gets contrib.gis working again.
1b8b9686fa Fixed #7947 -- Handle the display of OneToOneField in model forms correctly. Thanks tyson for the report and original patch.
640e930dc1 Fixed a typo from [8461] and deleted the real duplicate name (restored the inadvertently deleted name).
0d3dd8b68b Fixed #8485: Reordered imports in the database backends to ensure that the availability of the MySQL and Oracle backends is confirmed before any attempt is made to use the backend. Many thanks to Karen Tracey for her work in narrowing down a number of vague reports into a concrete problem.
343c255016 Fixed #8366: Modified a test fixture to remove an unnecessary forward reference. Thanks to Ramiro Morales for the suggestion.
e054295fed Fixed #8136: Added a signal emission when an error is raised handling an error. This was required for the test client to handle missing 404.html templates and errors in the 404.html template. Thanks to danfairs for the report and fix.
462ee405fb Fixed #8446 -- Typo fix in the French translation. Thanks, steadicat.
5d2e4752d2 Fixed #8456 -- Updated Georgian translation from David Avsajanishvili.
2b7ef577c3 We value Petr Marhoun's contributions very much, but he should still only appear once in the AUTHORS file. Fixed #8445.
f2477b6450 Fixed #7233 -- Ensured that QueryDict classes are always unpicklable. This problem only arose on some systems, since it depends upon the order in which the attributes are pickled. Makes reliable testing kind of tricky.
c8c159cbba When logging in, change the session key whilst preserving any existing sesssion. This means the user will see their session preserved across a login boundary, but somebody snooping the anonymous session key won't be able to view the authenticated session data.
2f7d624391 Estonian updates (Thanks Erik Allik)
d05d724165 Fixed #8376 -- Use request.path and request.path_info at the right moments when serving data in the flatpage middleware. Patch from jcassee.
1e1f7c58bc Fixed #8381 -- Fixed a problem with appending slashes in the common middleware when SCRIPT_NAME contains something other than '/'. Patch from jcassee.
b9407b26df Made it possible to pickle DateQuerySets.
eb85af1865 Fixed #8457 -- Fixed a missing import.
e94d293504 There are some variations in the printed names of exceptions between Oracle and other database backends, but the exception classes should still be the same. This commit changes the way the tests check for specific database errors to be more portable between implementations.
5608dfabc3 Fixed #8434 -- I forgot to update the tests when committing [8443]. Thanks, jarrow.
32ed714b5b Refs #8445, Updated Czech translation. Thanks Petr Marhoun
144e1fdbba Small update to German translation, removes unneeded strings
cae5e6e6a5 Closes #8427, Updated Norwegian translation (Thanks jonklo).
db76b1e89d Fixed Oracle backend not to use extra_select for limit/offset type queries, which fixes a majority of the currently failing tests.  Thanks, Ramiro Morales.
e7769c36e9 Fixed #8410 -- Added a missing piece of value encoding for the memcached backend. Patch from trbs.
ba937e55ae Fixed #8415 -- Fixed a typo in the localflavor for the Netherlands. Thanks, Niels Poppe.
f748fa2762 Fixed #7908: Added validation checks on attempts to create ForeignKey and M2M relations with abstract classes. Thanks to Rock Howard for the report.

7fecbe42a8 Fixed #8176 -- Updated Japanese translation from Takashi Matsuo.
c1e44b92f3  * Updated Swedish translations. These are now at 100%, so put your viking party hats on.
463b325cb6 GeoDjango users may now use `django.contrib.gis.tests.run_tests` for their `TEST_RUNNER` so that a testing spatial database is properly created; the GeoDjango test suite runner is renamed to `run_gis_tests`.
62aafd8e30 Moved admin form helpers to their own module to clean-up django/contrib/admin/options.py a little bit.
ee7a5cdd7d Fixed #8392 -- Corrected a typo in the project urls.py template. Thanks ramiro for the patch.
aeb7639951 Fixed `GeoQuery.get_columns()` to be compatible with the changes in r8426.
e6780acaf2 Updated German translation
556fbc78a6 Fixed #8039 -- Make sure that extra(tables=...) tables are always included in the resulting SQL. Previously, an optimisation was removing them in some corner cases.
b25d759bed Fixed #8113.  Made `get_width_height` a `GoogleZoom` method that takes the extent instead of an envelope so it may handle Point geometries.  Thanks to Santiago Aguiar for the bug report.
e3ea9ddef5 Added a test to show that #8063 doesn't seem to be an issue any longer. Refs #8063.
2c4b13cbe7 Changed the (internal) way extra(select=.., select_params=...) handling is done so that parameters stay with their select items. This means that merging and trimming of those items is handled correctly.
c92b424e57 Fixed #8239 -- Google App Engine has a restricted "imp" module, which doesn't include one of the methods we use when constructing management help commands. So postpone the resolving of the method name until when we actually need it (which isn't run as part of GAE). Patch from Guido van Rossum.
98be841549 Fixed #8238 -- If an invalid database backend is mentioned in settings and the environment doesn't support os.listdir(), we crashed whilst trying to construct the friendly error message. This was not so friendly.
a80a5ae46f Fixed #8374 -- Add the admindocs/templates/ directory to the source tarball that is built.

15f8b4cde0 Fixed #8178: Another update to debug template to aid rendering of exception traces. Thanks to julianb for the report.
260510453f Fixed #7241 -- More robust exception catching in the transaction management code. As pointed out in the ticket, Python still lets you raise all sorts of odd things as exceptions (e.g. strings), so even though they're bad form, we should still handle them. We do that cleanly now. Thanks to jim-django@dsdd.org for the patch.
2d2396a384 Fixed #5133 -- Explicitly close memcached connections after each request (similar to database connection management). We can't effectively manage the lifecycle by pooling connections and recent versions of python-memcache can lead to connection exhaustion in some quite reasonable setups.

7c6071861e Fixed #8132 -- Updated tutorial 2 to describe the current way to customise the main admin page. Based on a patch from julien.

a2be52fd2a Fixed #6547, added support for GeoRSS feeds in `django.contrib.gis.feeds`; added the `feed_extra_kwargs` and `item_extra_kwargs` to the `Feed` baseclass so that it's possible for subclasses to add dynamic attributes.
c127f0117d Fixed #8283 -- Fixed an edge case when adding things to the "where" tree and combining different connector types.
4dece4fba1 Updated the es_AR localization. There was no need to update djangojs domain files.
844089de07 Fixed #8315 -- If an exception is raised whilst trying to rollback a transaction (after another exception in the code), make sure the original exception is reported, rather than the rollback-generated one. The latter is almost certainly a consequence of the former. Patch from Karen Tracey.
54f9a98713 Fixed #8351 -- Fixed the returned value when we attempt to load a cache-backed session object that doesn't alreayd exist.
6bcb4935f2 Fixed #8007: removed mention of admin options in models from docs/design_philosophies.txt
df284da44f Fixed #8267: Corrected documentation for default value of DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE setting

fc2c03b55c Fixed #8268: Modified admin scripts tests to use JYTHONPATH when appropriate. Thanks to leosoto for the patch.
2b82a3bcfc Fixed #7331 -- Made `QueryDict.iteritems` behave like `QueryDict.items`, thanks jurev.
ddc156bca2 Fixed #6970 -- Raise the original `IntegrityError` when all required fields aren't specified in `get_or_create` instead of a misleading `DoesNotExist` error, thanks deadwisdom.
3b45a40c54 Fixed #8219 -- More robust date to string conversion in syndication feeds. (Sometimes) Affects people running in locales that use non-ASCII date strings. Patch from alperkanat.
f67fb604ea Fixed #8341 -- Allow simpler subclassing of ModelAdmin and InlineModelAdmin when overriding get_form and get_formset and needing to pass keyword argument on to the factory functions. Thanks ciantic for the report.

Instead, use the `path`, `url`, and `size` attributes and `save` method on the field itself, respectively.  * The `get_FIELD_width` and `get_FIELD_height` methods for Models with `ImageField` fields were removed.

Also:  * Model init no longer performs a database query to refetch the related objects it is passed.  * Model init now caches unsaved related objects correctly, too. (Previously, accessing the field would raise `DoesNotExist` error for `null=False` fields.)  * Added tests for assigning `None` to `null=True` `ForeignKey` fields (refs #6886).
b5c5e8b4c0 Reverted [8182]. Accidently committed from the wrong branch.

525e1e379a Fixed #7922 -- admin.autodiscover() no longer eats ImportErrors for breakfast. Thanks Jan Rademaker and Alex Gaynor for their work on the ticket.
be17a801f6 Fixed #7885 -- Prevent duplicates in fields and fieldsets declarations. Thanks julien and wamberg for the patches.
64f5ab67a5 Changed some URL conf regexes to rawstrings for consistency

9a56fe765e Corrected a typo in [8158]. Thanks to Matthias Kestenholz <mk@spinlock.ch> for the report.
f423dde34a Fixed #7978 -- Modified the contrib.sites tests to guarantee the initial conditions of the test match meet the requirements of the test. Thanks to Evan Schulz for the report and fix.
99e34c1846 Fixed #8042 -- Modified the password reset form so that the email field length matches the User model. Thanks to Bob Thomas <bthomas@ncircle.com> for the report.
9ea8184da8 Refs #8047 -- Removed some CPython specific parts of the admin scripts tests.
7a87f5aeab Fixed #8053 -- Corrected a bug with reset and m2m intermediate tables. Thanks to d00gs for the report and fix.
004ff03a8e Removed TEST_COOKIE_NAME and TEST_COOKIE_VALUE constants from sessions.middleware. They haven't been used here since the great refactor and are duplicated in sessions.backends.base.SessionBase.
8880fdd9ee Fixed #7935 -- Corrected typo in template docs, plus slightly clarified the language. Thanks to jturnbull for the suggestion.
f7d123a731 Fixed #7880 -- Corrected the handling of fields in the admin that specify choices, so that the presence of choices overrides the decision to use a custom admin widget. This is primarily of interest to Date/Time fields. Thanks to camilonova for the report.
a98d12b1b2 Fixed #7998 -- Corrected typo. Thanks to ElliotM for the report.
56bbe0aa46 Fixed #7990 -- Modified serializers to use StringIO, rather than cStringIO, due to potential unicode issues.

0dc11a0c1d Fixed #8029 -- Modified admin_scripts test to use the PYTHONPATH from the environment where the test is executed. Thanks to Ramiro and Alex Gaynor for the report.
74dde43989 The help_text attribute in forms can be a ugettext_lazy() object, so be careful not to trigger translations at import time.
ea45a932d3 A couple of small typo fixes in the settings docs. Fixed #8032.
b7e74e5e56 Fixed #8028 -- A couple of small docstring fixes from [8131]. Thanks, Leo Soto.

281f2b74bf Fixed #8023 -- Allow filtering of DecimalFields (in models) using strings.
1ba2d6888f Since max_digits and decimal_places are required on django.db.models.DecimalField, one of the tests was a bit bogus. Fixed that.
ab07a9b19f Added a clarification to the docs about filtering across nullable intermediate models with a NULL entry. I'm not brilliantly happy with the description (it's too long for such an edge case, for a start), but it gets the intent across. Refs #8025.
a14fc40041 Fixed #7913 -- Corrected ham-fisted typo from [8102]. Thanks to evinrik for the report.
b69b15fe02 Fixed a subtle bug (really, an inconsistency) in ForeignKey that [8132] exposed by causing the model_forms test to fail.

174641b9b3 Fixed #6095 -- Added the ability to specify the model to use to manage a ManyToManyField. Thanks to Eric Florenzano for his excellent work on this patch.

b6fe483bf5 Fixed #1157 -- Added some text to i18n.txt to explain how to install the necessary gettext tools on Windows (relevant to translators only). Thanks, Ramiro Morales.
548ac72207 Fixed #7589 -- Added a way for post-table-creation SQL modifications to be done for custom fields (needed by geo-django, but useful in other situations, too).
af7773f280 Fixed #8011 -- Be careful not to evalute lazy-translated Meta.verbose_name values whilst importing models.
b3b71a0922 Fixed #7560 -- Moved a lot of the value conversion preparation for loading/saving interactions with the databases into django.db.backend. This helps external db backend writers and removes a bunch of database-specific if-tests in django.db.models.fields.
7bc728c826 A few corrections to my docstrings in [8129].
96cf3656c4 Fixed #6997 -- Corrected `num_pages` calculation when one item is in the object list and `allow_empty_first_page=False`, thanks to framos for the report.  Also, made Page's `start_index()` return 0 if there are no items in the object list (previously it was returning 1, but now it is consistent with `end_index()`).  As an added bonus, I threw in quite a few pagination tests.
19c7db0058 Fixed #7853 -- Fixed another case of deleting inherited models with foreign key references. Thanks to Russell for the test case that demonstrated the problem.
55ba38f9d2 Put back [8120] along with a small tweak. Fixed #6217.
eca5aacec8 Back out [8120] for a bit. Refs #6217. It's having unintended side-effects (a.k.a breaks the tree)
4b6766cd6b Remove the last remaining references to manipulators outside of oldforms docs
d57ce3d6a9 Fixed #7131 -- Updated included simplejson code to match the simplejson-1.9.2 release. This should be fully backwards-compatible for people using the public interfaces.
de9e2ae5bb Removing another mention of manipulators
fdff91ac2d Remove a couple mentions of manipulators (which are no longer relevant) from docs/model-api.txt
9a5301ccbc Made the Paginator class a bit more backwards compatible with the lecacy `ObjectPaginator` class by using the `ObjectPaginator`'s `_get_count` method.  Instead of explicitly checking for an instance of `QuerySet`, this now allows any object with a `count()` or `__len__()` method defined to be passed to Paginator.  For one, this is useful when you have custom `QuerySet`-like classes that implement a `count()` method but don't inherit from `QuerySet` explicitly.
6a287ed946 Fixed #6217 -- Reduced the memory used by each ugettext_lazy() call. Thanks to Jakub Wilk for analysis and the initial patch.
7d1c147bb4 Fixed #7320 -- For `object_list` generic view, the `page` argument can also be the string "last", thanks Ubercore.
7b89abaf48 Missing compiled messages file from previous commit.
03ef8ac114 Updated Polish translation (Austrian localflavor)

82a85fdbae Fixed #6427 -- Added some more features to the Austrian localflavor. Thanks, Horst Gutmann.
2c6d1e8ebc Fixed #7886 -- Reordered some code in Query.results_iter() to ensure that all the prequisites are correctly initialised prior to using them. Only affects Oracle and other db backends requiring resolve_columns() (e.g. MS SQL?)
156b21a339 Removed trailing whitespace in admin docs.
b1c0dc5a01 Normalized the use of "JavaScript" in the documentation.
633ed5c4c9 Fixed #7986 -- Added to the documentation the purpose of the `prepopulated_fields` `ModelAdmin` option now that its no longer just a parameter for `SlugField` fields, thanks frasern.
ce15b389c1 Fixed the admin_scripts tests to check for the right output with Python 2.4.

020f965087 Fixed #7988 -- Corrected import of the warnings module, thanks richardh.

830b750131 Added missing svn:ignore property.
661f62be3c Fixed #7913 -- Corrected backwards incompatible parts of [7977] when optgroup handling was added to field choices (Ticket #4412). Thanks to Michael Elsdorfer (miracle2k) for the report and patch.
0e629b01c0 Added missing svn:ignore property.
3cbe73692e Fixed #7778 -- Fixed a tricky case of foreign key clearing with inherited models. Patch from James Murty.

f48855178d Fixed #7530, #7716 -- When using select_related() and encountering a NULL related object, populate the attribute correctly. Patch from Bastien Kleineidam.
aee55ce524 Changed one of the model_formsets tests to be immune to the differences in the natural collation ordering used by different databases (normally, this test would fail on PostgreSQL, but not because the code was incorrect). This is purely a test tweak.
103d484807 Fixed #7658 -- Added some Windows-specific tempfile handling. The standard stuff doesn't work with the way Django's file uploading code wants to operate. Patch from Mike Axiak.
e29aece743 Fixed #4534 -- Added an "else" option to the "ifchanged" template tag. Patch from SmileyChris.
f763ff4d02 Fixed #7809 -- A few small updates to the French translation. Thanks, cbay.
03373f1e24 Fixed #7345 -- In [8089], I'd forgotten that urlparse.urlsplit() didn't return something with attributes until Python 2.5. Thanks, Honza Kral and apollo13.

108b604b51 Fixed #7345 -- When normalising the URLField form field, attach a trailing slash when only a host (no path) is given. Thanks, jpwatts.
badde8a7e5 Fixed #7793 -- Handle sitemaps with more than 50,000 URLs in them (by using pagination). Patch from Julian Bez.
a26ba33111 Fixed #7686 -- Added an Austrian localflavor. Thanks, bernd.
319a31464d Fixed #7966 -- Send email if it has "bcc" recipients and no "to" recipients. Patch from Zal.
fe240b18f6 Removed some completely pointless test changes from [8084], since they were already being tested. Thank, Marty. /me is dumb. :-(
6f16b5bad2 Fixed #7967 -- Make sure the __contains__ method in the cache backends call the right has_key() method for the subclass. Patch from Marty Alchin.
f49c5c23f9 Fixed #7574 -- Fixed the handling of lazy translation in email headers.
b149e3d9e7 Corrected typo.
4ec2b8904b Fixed #7948 -- Fixed a typo in the linebreaks filter documentation, pointed out by Joel Kitching.
f8713ee243 Fixed #7959 -- Small typo fix in pt_BR. Thanks, marinho.

ecdd071794 Fixed #7951 -- Corrected typo in FAQ. Thanks to vulcan_eager for the report.
dd5194ad7e Update to the Italian translation. No msgstr changed/added/deleted, just line numbers in comments. Also fixes #7945: thanks, garcia_marc.
96d141dfda Fixed Oracle backend failure in test suite for modeltests.queries.  Item.objects.all()[0:0] was optimizing out the limits clause and returning all rows.
f5801e5fd1 Updated Polish translation
466ddfa798 Updated Spanish translation.
9237466bee Removed a colon that was rendering the bullet-point list below it as code in docs/admin.txt.
4e723f9571 Fixed #7897 -- Corrected some spelling and grammatical errors in the InlineModelAdmin objects documentation. Thanks arthurk and Karen Tracey for catching these.
7b3cf13d32 Improved admin model registration options: you can now register using register(Model, **options) and even register(Model, ModelAdmin, **options). This isn't documented yet -- a much expanded version of docs/admin.txt is on the way.
508016c0f4 Fixed #7914 -- Added some missing __init__.py files that were missed when the ping_google command was added. Thanks to bernd for the report.
a7b556ca04 Allow for matches against unsaved objects in querysets (which will therefore match nothing). This allows for some more straightforward code in the admin interface.
3912403550 Added the ability to customize the prefix value on an inline formset. Fixes #7899. AThanks for the tip Peter of the Norse.
681e7bbd25 Removed some potentially misleading code (it isn't executed) after the changes in [8055]. Thanks, Karen. Refs #7745.
9d8f41baac Made the semi-private _max_form_count live on the public API of formsets by renaming it to max_num. This also removes the ManagementForm use of MAX_COUNT since that usage should just be referenced to the formset's max_num property. Refs #7899. Thanks Peter of the Norse for straightening me out.
62d9e278d7 Fixed #7898 -- Moved formset media definition to a media property in InlineAdminFormSet display helper and added InlineAdminForm media at the same time. This now properly renders all media associated with the formset and its display helper children. Thanks dima.kozlov for the report.
437945146d Fixed #7906 -- Modified admin_scripts regression test to use the same python executable that is running the test suite, rather than using 'python' on the path. Thanks to Chris Hasenpflug for the report.
c5a76a3669 Fixed a bunch of Python 2.3 test failures.
d1ea8b2842 Changed the test from [8052] so that it is insensitive to whether a database sorts NULLs first or last in a sequence or results.
8745beccb1 Fixed #7813 -- Allow pickling of Query classes that use select_related(). Based on a patch from Justin Bronn.
83e97ecf88 Fixed #7791 -- Fixed a really silly error I introduced in [7926]. :-(
0e9587fd6b Fixed the tests from [8033] to work for the PostgreSQL backends (the primary key value isn't guaranteed to be the same across all backends). Still some breakage on MySQL because of the way it treats booleans, but that's another issue.
6ef47cfe5f To ensure that a model BooleanField has an explicit value set (and since it's not required, by default), set the default properly in the constructor.
c51d000c37 Fixed #7870 -- Fixed typo in docs/forms.txt. Bad form, whoever originally wrote that
f5328f4c38 Fixed #7841 -- Fixed typo in docs/forms.txt. Thanks, msaelices

cf2a05952e Fixed #7868 -- Updated FAQ 'When will you release 1.0' to have an actual, valid answer
8bc442e771 Fixed #7304 -- Gave AnonymousUser a has_perms() method, which it was lacking
bfcecfee91 Fixed #7814 -- Fixed a number of style inconsistencies in the docs. Thanks, uzi and programmerq
ca98003390 Fixed spaces vs. tabs issue in docs/contenttypes.txt from [7976]
46c7941de3 Fixed badly worded comment in setup.py osx_install_data(). It's better but still doesn't do a good job of explaining what the heck is going on
459a7965dd Changed "each" to "ease" and made several edits from Adrian.
cee642bcb8 Fixed a few formatting errors and typos, courtesy of the proofreaders in #django-dev.
2ba74aeb89 1.0 alpha release notes
d3f4de9c18 Bumped version number for 1.0-alpha release.
863f4eb1d7 Fixed #6755: model inheritance now works in the admin. Thanks, sloonz and Michael Placentra.
c236874c48 Fixed #7871 -- Added some more bullet-proofing in PATH_INFO determination, since Django would like it to at least contain a '/' (rather than being an empty string).
1ef86fdf2b Fixed #7869 -- Removed a reference to an inner Admin class in docs/contributing.txt. Thanks John Scott.
384a721e1c Fixed #7825 - modeltests/delete tests failing after NFA merge, and improved documentation of these tests.
fb51608332 It's time for the "newforms" documentation to arrive:  * Removed the "more coming soon" section from bottom of "newforms" docs.  * Removed note on "oldforms" docs that "we have begun to document" newforms.
3a2686a70d Added a link to admin docs in add_ons.txt. Refs #7829.
ba6d7e1bae Improved the bit of the tutorial that explains how to enable the admin. Fixes #7824.

8b1684e676 Corrected link to ModelForm doc.
ce3bdc86d4 Refs #7864 -- Corrected more instances of "newforms" in the docs.
4dd242bdeb Corrected the privileges needed to run the test suite under Oracle
24aa08f486 Refs #7864 -- Updates to documentation for the oldforms/newforms switch.  * Moved forms.txt to oldforms.txt  * Moved newforms.txt to forms.txt  * Updated links and most references to "newforms" (there are a few sections that need a more significant rewrite).
f28474547b Fixed #7414: fixed setup.py on OSX 10.5. Thanks, ajs.
4f1cbaa93e Moved RedirectAdmin in django.contrib.redirects to an admin.py module.
970611827b FIxed #7666: use a bare queryset when accessing single related objects so that the related objects never become inaccessible.
4016d5264a Fixed #7727 -- Improved the checks for import failure when using PIL. Under PyPy, you can import the PIL module, but when you try to use it, the underlying _imaging module will not be available. Thanks to Maciej Fijalkowski (fijal) for the report and suggested fix.
bfcecbffd3 Changed/fixed the way Django handles SCRIPT_NAME and PATH_INFO (or equivalents). Basically, URL resolving will only use the PATH_INFO and the SCRIPT_NAME will be prepended by reverse() automatically. Allows for more portable development and installation. Also exposes SCRIPT_NAME in the HttpRequest instance.
ca7ee4be17 Fixed #7858 -- Quick CSS fix for right-to-left written languages in inlines. Thanks mksoft for the report and patch.
80ac41e2f7 Corrected typo.
ee90b7cf9a Fixed filter_horizontal and filter_vertical handling in admin so that they can be lists (aren't required to be tuples). It's less error-prone to use one item lists than one-tuples, but this caused a crash.
c2ee295f50 Fixed #7850 -- Added adding django.contrib.admin to INSTALLED_APPS to the steps to activating the Django admin site. Thanks dacort for the report.
effa299342 Added admin.autodiscover() to project template urls.py. It is left commented out intentionally. Thanks tome for the suggestion. Refs #7824.
a53a1ba541 Fixed #7842 -- Added a raw string identifier in project template urls.py for consistency sake. Added spaces for consistency too. Thanks yoshi.

6c4c60b14a Fixed #7775 -- Removed some duplicated code from the admin login sequence. Thanks to Mnewman for the report.
6db9fd0116 Made the test case for doctest comparison of XML fragments a little more rigorous. Refs #7441.
b58de15139 Fixed #7339 -- Added manual calls to the garbage collector. This is required for PyPy and Jython; these implementations don't use reference counting, so you can't rely on __del__ being run immediately after del is called. Thanks to Maciej Fijalkowski (fijal) and Leo Soto.
2f49d18071 Fixed #7441 -- Removed some of the shortcuts in the doctest output comparators, and added a wrapper to allow comparison of xml fragments. Thanks to Leo Soto for the report and fix.
55ebc2b594 Modified [7999] based on some feedback from Marty Alchin.
44c329e1d3 Update es_AR l10n to post nf-a merging (actually r7984). Yay for first commit :).
e942636fbe Added a cavaet to the use of get_FOO_filename() and get_FOO_url(). This constraint has always existed, but it's very hard to fix in the current code, so better to work around it for now.
5141b67a19 Reverted [7986].
a4619944dc it translation: updated to r7996
be922f1ba5 it translation: regenerated po file, now let's get to work
189c704ae6 Revert [7991] - [7993]. I was committing from the wrong branch. Sorry 'bout that, folks. :-(

ff68e85b8e Starting to do the reverse() threading stuff.
99bbaa0090 Allow avoidance of the Apache mod_rewrite undo.
b653cdcfb2 First part of setting request.path correctly.

8ac9cbee2f Fixed #7763 -- Added a Romanian localflavor. Thanks, MihaiD.
795b6a1271 Fixed #7471 -- If the 400 response handler raises an exception, pass control to the 500 handler (if that then raises an exception, it's just not your day).
344383284c Fixed #6009 -- Added regression tests to show that uploading non-ASCII filenames now works properly. Patch from Leah Culver.
a103786971 Fixed #5619 -- Return the same path in get_FOO_filename() before and after a model is saved (i.e. make sure the upload prefix is prepended in both cases).
c09351aec6 Fixed #6965 -- Sped up the urlize and urlizetrunc filters. A nice patch from Andrew Badr.
67eeb72e26 Fixed #7838 -- Corrected an invalid class name the 'classes' usage in the tutorial. Thanks kratorius for catching this.
4729e3836e Fixed #7839 -- Corrected admin documentation and tutorial to reflect that 'classes' should be a list and not a string. Thanks Jan Rademaker for the patch.
dce4db49a7 Added svn:ignore properties to some recently added directories.
0cffff024b Fixed #7441 - Improved the doctest OutputChecker to be more lenient with JSON an XML outputs. This is required so that output ordering that doesn't matter at a semantic level (such as the order of keys in a JSON dictionary, or attributes in an XML element) isn't caught as a test failure.  Thanks to Leo Soto for the patch.
c819252bf5 Fixed #7832 -- Corrected a formatting error in the newforms docs. Thanks to omat@gezgin.com for the report.
649463dd34 Fixed #4412 -- Added support for optgroups, both in the model when defining choices, and in the form field and widgets when the optgroups are displayed. Thanks to Matt McClanahan <cardinal@dodds.net>, Tai Lee <real.human@mrmachine.net> and SmileyChris for their contributions at various stages in the life of this ticket.
b5b0febc4c Fixed #7785 -- Added a note in the contenttypes documentation that GenericRelations must share a common field type for primary keys. Thanks to Rudolph for the suggestion and initial draft.
825622d912 Fixed #7773 -- Added some simple tests for EmailMessage. Thanks to serialx for the patch.
69ac815a41 Fixed #7828 -- Removed some unnecessary imports from admin widgets. Thanks to Julien for the report.
56df66baa0 Removed a stale directory missed by [7967].
d70df568e6 Fixed #7558 -- Added missing svn:ignore property on some directories that were missing it. Thanks to Marc Garcia for the report.

88a6fa5a07 Fixed some linking errors in the FAQ.
b5f92938ab Fixed #7298: prevent update() on sliced QuerySet since UPDATE doesn't reliably support LIMIT/OFFSET. Thanks, George Vilches.
12716794db Fixed #7350, #7202 -- Fixed serialization for multi-model inheritance, which had multiple problems:  * Serializers were including all superclass fields in their output. Now only local fields are included.  * Implicit OneToOne primary keys were not correctly added to the metamodel, so they were always marked to be serialized, even though they were primary  * Model saving was too aggressive about creating new parent class instances during deserialization. Raw save on a model now skips saving of the parent class.

Thanks to John Shaffer for the suggestion, and Keith Bussell for his work on the fix.

3de70a10c0 Fixed #6820: flush no longer fails under PostgreSQL 8.3. WARNING: In the process I renamed a couple of internal functions in django.core.management.sql, so this is a backwards-incompatible change if you were using those internal functions.

a97f690e5d Added the ability to pickle and unpickle QuerySets and Query classes.
db80f57c6e ValuesQuerySets (and subclasses) were inadvertently not caching their results. Fixed.

ff6e529502 Added a test to demonstrate the remaining problem in #7095.
1bb8260084 Allow Query objects to be values in query filters. This already existed for relations, but not for normal fields. The latter comes up naturally in some update statements.

4c3fcbc4bc [docs] OK, I give up.
905b246dad [docs] And even more svn:keywords fooling. Sorry about the timeline spam.

95665c403b [docs] Added svn:keywords to docs/index.txt
7dd4be581b Added the basics needed to build Django's docs using [http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ Sphinx]. If you've got Sphinx installed (the latest version) along with [http://docutils.sf.net docutils], you should be able to easily build the docs locally using {{{sphinx-build}}} or the included {{{Makefile}}}. This use a basic (and pretty crappy) index for the documentation and the built-in Sphinx styles (which are actually quite nice).

a9a70bfe55 Fixed #6859 -- Greatly cleaned up the section on i18n pluralization in Javascript. With new example code and everything! Thanks, Ramiro Morales.
eb6a6c4619 Fixed #6864 -- Handle Javascript i18n when the plural form expression returns True or False (so both booleans and integers are allowed). Thanks, Ramiro Morales.
622a6447f9 Fixed #6868 -- Fixed test results for Windows systems. Thanks, Ned Batchelder.

516102dc75 FIxed #6513 -- Handle overflows better in the floatformat filter. It's not possible to test this automatically everywhere due to differing representations on different platforms. Manual testing confirms it works, though.
463a03d7e3 Fixed #6825 -- Fixed the model_forms tests to also work on Windows by making the filename detection a lot looser. Thanks, jerickso.
c0537a961f Fixed #6616 -- Added an is_ajax() method to HttpRequest that uses the de facto standard header for detecting an XmlHttpRequest call. Thanks, Daniel Lindsley.
c01e6b852a Fixed #6486 -- Added local server time to the debug output page. Patch from Bastian Kleineidam and Thomas Güttler.
f8578d7f19 Forgot to commit a new file from [7328].
b3b8422363 Fixed #6445 -- Allow model instances to be used as a default for ForeignKeys (via a callable). Also updates the documentation of the "default" attribute to indicate a callable can be used. Thanks, Philipe Raoult.

4457ba002d Fixed #5894: added FilePathField to newforms. Thanks, Alex Gaynor.
bc1f67a6de Replaced dict reprs in tests with explicit looks at each key. This should fix many spurious test failures on other VMs (first noticed on Jython).
6035af82d4 Fixed #6789 -- Added some small amount of extra protection for learners trying to pick a name for their project. Thanks, thejaswi_puthraya.
32933d27b2 Fixed a corner case in management.setup_environ (it was triggered under Cygwin, but also perhaps could happen elsewhere). Thanks, Doug Napoleone.

6c2a78b266 Changed pagination tests to suppress the DeprecationWarning
08d4910d69 Changed list_detail.object_list generic view to use the new Paginator class. This is backwards-compatible -- the previous 12 template context variables (has_next, has_previous, etc.) are still passed to the template, but new templates should only access the new template variables 'paginator' and 'page_obj'
d67208f5be Added a new and improved Paginator class, which allows you to pass a Page object to the template instead of 5 or 6 separate variables. ObjectPaginator still exists for backwards compatibility but issues a DeprecationWarning

cc083724c1 Fixed #6382: Documented request.urlconf

9b52f35f35 Added "svn:eol-style native" to every text file in the tree (*.txt, *.html, *.py, *.xml and AUTHORS, etc). Added "svn:ignore *.pyc" to some directories in tests/regressiontests/ that were previously missing it.
5b8974c7b3 Fixed #5574  -- Serialize a FileField using its filename from the database, not external URL. The problem showed up when reloading the data. Patch from Chris Henderson.

5ca0b9203b Fixed #5701 -- Fixed decorators to take the name, attributes, and docstring of the function they decorate by adding a modified version of the `functools.wraps` function from Python 2.5.  `wraps` has been altered to work with Django's `curry` function and with Python 2.3, which doesn't allow assignment of a function's `__name__` attribute.  This fixes severaly annoyances, such as the online documentation for template filters served by the admin app.  This change is backwards incompatible if, for some reason, you were relying on the name of a Django decorator instead of the function it decorates.

68e43660d8 Fixed #6617 -- Added new Georgian (ka) translation from David Avsajanishvili.
6a796690e6 It makes sense that when you subclass an existing model field, you're often going to be using the same database column type. Made that properly inheritable (previously it was using the class name), at the cost of a little more verboseness.
343fa35a2c Fixed #2936, #6500 -- Added a __hash__() method to Models (since we implement our own __eq__ method).

6754be48ec Generic relations should not try to drop their related table in "sqlreset".
4c59ca6020 Changed ModelForms to allow inheritance as long as their model attributes are the same.
e415eff0ea Fixed #6162. ModelForm's __init__ signature now matches Form's. This is a backwards incompatbile change. Based largely on a patch by ubernostrum.
f9410dc40d Fixed #6151 -- Added some code formatting to the `floatformat` template filter doc section.  Thanks, adamv.
a4478ee9c6 Fixed #6174 -- Made `AnonymousUser.is_active` False instead of True since `AnonymousUser`s can't login.  Thanks, `SmileyChris`.

c39d6e89f1 Fixed #6158 -- Display PYTHONPATH on the debug error page. Thanks, annacoder.
8540731dc4 Fixed #6164 -- `field.label_tag` already displays the label so don't display it again.  Thanks, arien.
5adfae3062 Fixed #6107 -- Updated Catalan translation from Marc Fargas.
ed5eca598e Fixed ORA-01461 error when trying to store more than 4000 bytes in a TextField under Oracle
f425cb8caa Fixe #6131 -- Fixed a problem with expired keys in the locmem cache. Based on a patch from sherbang.

5ed205bc8a Fixed #3906 -- Fixed the reverse_m2m_name for a generic relation. Refs #2749.
25f548a852 Fixed #6132: note to self: when you add new template tags, you need to remember to actually register them. Thanks, Ben Walton.
01ca122774 Fixed #6063 -- Caught one place in HttpResponse that was not returning a str type (violation of WSGI spec). Thanks, janusz.harkot@gmail.com.
86c417077d Changed wording of post-to-dpaste link based on a suggestion from Mordy Ovits
5684bdc3a4 Fixed a bug introduced in [6891]: the "safe" YAML serializer can't handle time types out of the box. I've worked around the bug by coercing times to strings, which is far from perfect. However, it's better than a Python-specific "!!python/time" type which would break interoperability (which was the goal of switching to the safe mode in the first place).
b65fce6595 Fixed #4131: added an "escapejs" filter for use in JavaScript strings, and updated the documentation on addslashes to point to the new ticket. Featuring contributions from Ned Batchelder, Jeremy Dunck, and Andy Durdin.
76b73ce725 Fixed #5268: the YAML serializer now uses yaml.safe_dump() instead the plain yaml.dump(); this makes YAML dumps more portable, and also removes the crufty '!!python/unicode' business. Thanks, poelzi.
35921e570b Added a test for [6889]
602b7bca7a Fixed #6082: file-based sessions now verify that SESSION_FILE_PATH is a valid storage location, and raise ImproperlyConfigured if not. Thanks, jags78.
76dd53ac08 Fixed #6116: mark-safe the admin changelist table class. Thanks, zlobnyi antisvin.
acfff050ec Fixed #6099: the filebased cache backend now uses md5 hashes of keys instead of sanitized filenames. For good measure, keys are partitioned into subdirectories using the first few bits of the hash. Thanks, sherbang.
91ca6f2e7e Fixed #6122: Fixed tests broken by [6872]. Thanks, Matt.
3911ee0931 Changed loaddata to display 'No fixtures found' and 'Loading XXX fixtures' only if verbosity level is greater than 2. It's not necessary to display those messages all of the time, and they're confusing to new users.
2863b28627 Changed 'Send to DPaste' link (from [6820]) on debug page to wording that's much less inside-basebally. Also changed it so that the button only shows up after clicking 'Switch to copy-and-paste view', so people know what they're getting into. Also unconverted some XHTML tags, as the page uses an HTML 4.01 doctype.

51dc4ecf94 Fixed #6042 -- ModelForms implementation from Joseph Kocherhans. Still might need a little tweaking as people start to use it, but this is mostly complete.
61947f0635 Fixed #3961 -- Added South African localflavor. Thanks, Russell Cloran.
805c364fcf Fixed #3511 -- Changed QuerySet.get() to return a MultipleObjectsReturned exception, rather than an assertion error. Thanks, Gary Wilson and cheeming.

c3a867228b Fixed #5909 -- Made the various django.contrib.comment models more robust in the face of non-ASCII characters by giving them a __unicode__ method and letting the default __repr__ use that. Patches from prairiedogg and scompt.
f86e54e3b0 Added better error handling in the basic feed class example. Refs #5855
d94ed44c5d Fixed #5854 -- Added an example to the newforms documentation showing how to highlight required fields (which should also provide enough clues for accessing other attributes on newforms.Field subclasses. Thanks, christobzr@gmail.com.
8d29fabe31 Fixed #5853 -- Added handling for a missing 'en' PO file in translation support (this file being missing is essentially harmless). Thanks, miracle2k.
6044ce9898 Updated the English PO and MO files.
5cd153b7c8 Fixed #5777 -- Recommend using a symbolic link on Linux, OSX, etc for django-admin.py so that subversion updates keep it up to date. Patch from arien.

3c272792d6 Added tests and a small optimisation for [6721]. Thanks SmileyChris. Fixed #6049
b1df360961 Testing once again -- sorry!.
45ab2567a6 Testing again -- please ignore.
d698f319e4 Testing -- please ignore.
9130765ff9 Fixed #5890 -- fixed the far edge-case of allowing constant strings inside template template markers: we now treat embedded, escaped double quotes consistently with constant string arguments to filters. Patch from Dmitri Fedortchenko.
5a5a71edcd Fixed #5991 -- Marked the generated HTML for newforms.extra.SelectDateWidget as safe. Patch from alberto.piai@gmail.com.
1c87a7bb58 Fixed #5730: Conditionally escape widget contents in newforms to avoid inadvertent double-escaping. This still isn't perfect behaviour (since it's unaware of the current context's auto-escaping setting), but that's a larger problem that needs fixing and this change at least makes the existing behaviour consistent. Patch from SmileyChris.
dc716112a7 Fixed an edge-case for auto-escaping: if the stringfilter decorator is used and generates a first argument that is a safe string, make the is_safe handling work as expect.
2d0d6620e6 Fixed #6015 -- Fixed a CSS escaping issue for admin's edit-inline.
8f70eb5b50 FIxed #5951 -- Updated Polish translation. Thanks, Jarek Zgoda.

c7181ec0ff Made `MultiValueDict`'s `get` and `getlist` method docstrings more descriptive.
891cc5df92 Minor styling fix in `DotExpandedDict.__init__`.
303d22b0d2 Changed several hardcoding of `dict` method calls in `django.utils.datastructures.py` to use `super` instead.

dab8503146 Corrected a docstring in django.test.TestCase to match the actual behavior.
900811f401 Fixed #5981 -- Fixed failing regression test when using locmem cache backend.  Changed `add` to pickle the value as is done in `set`.  Based on patch from mattmcc.

6522e0697a Fixed #5932 -- Use `self.pages` and not `self._pages` in `_get_page_range` so that an exception is not raised if `self.page_range` is accessed before `self.pages`.
1607acee40 Fixed #5978 -- Gave `LOCALE_PATHS` a default setting of an empty tuple and removed some code that was checking for its existance in settings before accessing it.
331d4bba97 Fixed link to settings documentation in the i18n docs.
42c5a91388 Made use of `EMPTY_VALUES` in `ModelChoiceField.clean()`.

5870ffd4b0 Made some stylistic changes in `GZipMiddleware` and added some notes about IE, refs #5313.
34cc21983c Removed `vary_delim_re` in `django/utils/cache.py` in favor of existing `cc_delim_re` since the latter is more correct in parsing the header (allows whitespace before and after comma separators instead of just after).  As a bonus, tests added for `patch_vary_headers()`.
7d8ac66026 Added *.pyc ignore.
b2b6fc8e3c Fixed #5975 -- Gave `ModelChoiceField` and `ModelMultipleChoiceField` ability to specify custom error messages.
86ca11dd6d Rewrote the section about writing autoescaping-aware filters, based on feedback from Ivan Sagalaev.
38d972b9ec Fixed #5880 -- Fixed an XSS hole in the admin interface.  * Escaped text that gets sent after saving the admin foreignkey popup form.  * Added quotes around the second argument passed to `opener.dismissAddAnotherPopup` to make the function also work when a text field is used as the primary key.  * Added a `html_unescape` javascript function to unescape the strings passed in to the `dismissAddAnotherPopup` function so that the added choice displays correctly in the dropdown box.
5f8cfe99f3 Fixed #5969 -- Corrected a problem introduced in [6682].
ce73298e26 Fixed #5960 -- Fixed some Python 2.3 incompatibilities.
4bd75e8712 Fixed a couple of chained filter tests that weren't demonstrating what they claimed (since the "cut" filter's behaviour had changed since I originally wrote those tests).
4585b4d6c2 Fixed some missed auto-escaping and URL quoting cases in the urlize filter.
adcec0885d Fixed a few problems with variable resolving inside of blocktrans tags. A couple of these were exposed by the auto-escaping changes, but I suspect the other one has been hiding in plain sight for a while.
64c0bf8677 Translating safe strings should return a safe result.
0928fa5566 Fixed #5945 -- Treat string literals in template filter arguments as safe strings for auto-escaping purposes.
0b0ef3f0c5 Fixed #4713 -- Fixed handling of _() in template tag arguments. Based on patched from Indy and SmileyChris.

b58c55fc80 Fixed #5944 -- Added safe string markings to admin error messages in one place that was missed.
3322521cd6 Documented the time-saver in flatpages: title and content are marked as safe strings.
bdb0b903c2 Content coming via {{ block.super }} is always going to be correctly escaped already. We mark it as safe so that template authors don't need to.
356662cf74 Implemented auto-escaping of variable output in templates. Fully controllable by template authors and it's possible to write filters and templates that simulataneously work in both auto-escaped and non-auto-escaped environments if you need to. Fixed #2359
babfe78494 Fixed #4787, #5913 -- Updating the queryset on a `ModelChoiceField` or `ModelMultipleChoiceField` now updates its widget's choices.  The clean methods for `ModelChoiceField` and `ModelMultipleChoiceField` were changed to only allow choices in the specified queryset (instead of allowing all choices returned by the queryset model's default manager).
5e8be6978e Simplified `SortedDict.__deepcopy__` now that the its constructor can take a sequence of tuples.
a4907be38e Fixed #5918 -- Removed `SortedDictFromList` since `SortedDict` now can do everything `SortedDictFromList` could do.  Since `SortedDict`'s `copy` method doesn't return a deepcopy as `SortedDictFromList`'s `copy` method did, you will need to update your code if you were relying on `SortedDictFromList.copy` to return a deepcopy by using the `deepcopy` function from the `copy` module.
af256a02f9 Fixed #5890 -- Fixed a ReST markup error. Thanks, arien.
33206720f0 Fixed #5876 -- Updated Catalan translation from Marc Garcia.

3ee3d6b5f3 Fixed #5898 -- Changed a few response processing paths to make things harder to get wrong and easier to get right. Previous behaviour wasn't buggy, but it was harder to use than necessary.
30848dfe34 When using assertRedirect(), allow the caller to specify relative URLs and automatically fill in the hostname and scheme (host can be passed in, if different from the default).
1eecc5a47e Corrected a couple comments in `model_forms` tests.
8c9b65429a Fixed bug in /admin/doc/views/ caused by [6658]
8eeb9feab0 Fixed #4376 -- login_required now works with bound methods.  Thanks, Steven Bethard.
8216abe748 Documentation for creating custom model fields.
ea100b607a Added the small changes necessary to make creating custom model fields easier. Also includes some tests for this.
595e75e8dd Fixed #5729 -- For MySQL (only), always delay the creation of foreign key references, for all tables, until after the table has been created. This means that when using the InnoDB storage engine, true foreign key constraints are created (inline "REFERENCES" are ignored by InnoDB, unfortunately).
3f1ce2e602 Fixed #5640 -- Added some extra error reporting when smart_unicode() or force_unicode() raise a UnicodeDecodeError. This should at least help people identify which is the bad piece of data they passed in. About the best we can do here.

c599de2ac6 Added a BaseDatabaseOperations.last_executed_query() hook, which allows a database backend to specify how to get the last-executed query on a given cursor.

This means that for psycopg2, the SQL statements in django.db.connection.queries will now reflect the exact SQL as sent to the server, instead of a naive and misleading string-interpolated version

132605d889 Fixed #5086 -- The 'flush' and 'sqlflush' management commands no longer touch tables that Django is not aware of (tables that are not in INSTALLED_APPS and/or do not have associated models. Thanks for bringing this up, shaun@cuttshome.net
8b8a36c7d0 Changed postgresql and postgresql_psycopg2 backends NOT to do a SELECT version() for every connection, which was ludicrous. Now the version is only retrieved if it needs to be, via a lazy loader.

7c41b19c8a Refactored all database backends to inherit from a common base class to remove quite a bit of duplicated code. Thanks for the patch, Brian Harring. Refs #5106
77a9b0cb1d Edited docs/templates.txt change from [5938]
8d97f15b96 Fixed #4125 -- Added some small fixes to contrib.databrowse: fixed calendar views, added a summary of the number of objects in each list, and added a template entry point for the customisation enthusiasts. Nice work, SmileyChris.
0a49719e7a Used the url() function when adding a named URL pattern, mostly as an example of good practice and to introduce the function. Fixed #4908 (although it wasn't a bug).

3c89a32e52 Fixed #5197 -- Updated Spanish translation. Thanks, Mario Gonzalez.
7e8efcd4d9 Fixed #5087 -- Fixed support for TextField filtering with Oracle. Thanks, Ian Kelly.

4d42dc3846 Changed the URL reference for timezone specifications. It looks like PostgreSQL is removing that list from their docs (in 8.2) and this might also help avoid problems with people not noticing there are multiple entries per line in the current PostgreSQL docs.
5832ca5b7f Added appropriate svn properties to Polish localflavor code from [5936].
0a2337c9e3 Added links from any reference to the url template tag to the appropriate place in the template tag documentation. Fixed #5198.

390e91db51 Tweaked the unset primary key check from [5933] to accommodate models created in the oldforms style. It's a backwards-compatibility hack that we can remove when oldforms go away. See #2160 for discussion. Fixed #5204, #2160. Refs #5102.

a89e401648 Fixed 'django-admin.py syncdb' to take verbosity into account when loading initial_data fixture
3219a60167 Rewrote portions of the app- and model-cache initialisation to handle some corner cases. It is now possible to use m2m relations before everything is imported and still get the right results later when importing is complete. Also, get_apps() should always return the same results, so apps won't randomly disappear in the admin interface.
103fe15efc Added docstring to logout test case.
8dff1cd91d Fixed #5189 -- Added logout method to test Client. Thanks, Jakub Wisniowski <restless.being@gmail.com>.

f4d4936abf Added a return value to the test frameworks TestSMTPConnection.send_messages, to match the real implementation. Thanks for the suggestion and fix, Michael <absoludity@gmail.com>.
01adbb55e6 Major refactoring of django.core.management -- it's now a package rather than a 1730-line single module. All django-admin/manage.py commands are now stored in separate modules. This is backwards-incompatible for people who used django.core.management functions directly
7f06e44f99 Typo fix from [5896].
3835d8afec Fixed #4296 -- Added more explanation around the PythonPath directory setting. Based on contributions from a cast of thousands (Simon Greenhill, Paul Bissex, Graham Dumpleton, ...). Thanks, all.

f0ca553a68 Fixed #4880 -- Updated Spanish translation. Thanks, Mario Gonzalez.
4bf3680dfa If SITE_ID isn't in the test settings, fake it. We need the sites framework, but the value of SITE_ID is currently unimportant, so we can transparently fix this error.
ba29b7a97b Reverted [5887], at least for now. Both flatpages and redirects depend on the sites app.
4f62b0a193 Fixed some ReST errors in docs/testing.txt
3bfda4fa62 Removed stray tabs mistakenly added to docs/testing.txt in [5889]

b38375ee4c Fixed bug in [5885]
6aae9b2aa4 Changed django.contrib.auth.views.login to use RequestSite if the sites framework is not installed -- i.e., the sites framework is no longer required to use this view. See also [5654]

08c47803bb Removed 'LIMIT 1' from the [5882] change, as it's not supported by Oracle

478926ffde Fixed #5141 -- Added Croation translation. Thanks, Aljosa Mohorovic.

212ee65be7 Fixed #2101 -- Renamed `maxlength` argument to `max_length` for oldforms `FormField`s and db model `Field`s.  This is fully backwards compatible at the moment since the legacy `maxlength` argument is still supported.  Using `maxlength` will, however, issue a `PendingDeprecationWarning` when used.

5b8d2c9f0d Fixed bug with using values() and extra(select) in the same QuerySet, with a select dictionary containing more than a few elements. This bug was identified in unit test from [5767]. The problem was that we were relying on the dictionary's .items() ordering, which is undefined
8831f3ee2c Added unit test that confirms a bug in ValuesQuerySets that have extra(select) specified. If the select dictionary has several fields, Django assigns the wrong values to the select-field names
386a4c610c Added support for database cache table in test database.
812583ce3b Added section to docs/contributing.txt about docstring coding style
29078eaeca Fixed #4971 -- Fixed some escaping and quoting problems in the databrowse contrib app.  Based on patch from Johann Queuniet.

3b78695a64 Added documentation for a test runner argument that has always been present, but was undocumented.
1b7fe09660 Fixed #3771 -- Modified the test runner to observe the --noinput argument controlling script interactivity. This means that test scripts can now be put in a buildbot environment. This is a backwards incompatible change for anyone that has written a custom test runner. Thanks for the suggestion, moof@metamoof.net.
304381616f Fixed #4952 -- Fixed the `get_template_sources` functions of the `app_directories` and `filesystem` template loaders to not return paths outside of given template directories.  Both functions now make use of a new `safe_join` utility function.  Thanks to SmileyChris for help with the patch.
7a16a1d81a Corrected typo in [5746].
cae92ae615 Fixed #4373 -- Modified the get_object_or_404/get_list_or_404 shortcuts to also accept `QuerySet`s.  Thanks SuperJared.
63cc023eea Shortcut functions do not accept `QuerySet` objects, yet :)
d95e91b380 Added docstrings to shortcuts module and functions.
bac6a2f88e Fixed #4945 -- Removed unused `GET_ITERATOR_CHUNK_SIZE` definition from manager.py.  `GET_ITERATOR_CHUNK_SIZE` is already defined in query.py.  Thanks zigiDev@mac.com.
f2303b6f7a Fixed #4402 -- Modified test client to allow multi-valued inputs on GET requests. Thanks for the suggestion, eddymul@gmail.com.
6a4f164a6f Added test cases for change [5739].
ef080e44d0 Minor fix to allow for count=0 in assertContains.
7cc2bf2f03 Fixed #4304 -- Modified sys.exit to os._exit to make sure development server quits when an error occurs attempting to bind to the requested port (e.g., if another server is already running). Thanks, Mario Gonzalez <gonzalemario@gmail.com>.
910bbe8f1f Added some additional docs to docs/model-api.txt db_type() section
07dd6b2895 Fixed negligible typo in docstring in tests/regressiontests/test_client_regress/models.py from [5731]
f7ef0a92da Fixed #4738 -- Modified the prompt that is displayed when a test database cannot be created. The existing prompt was misleading if the issue wasn't a pre-existing database. Thanks for the suggestion, John Shaffer <jshaffer2112@gmail.com>.
56394220d5 Fixed #4901 -- Modified assertContains to provide a default check of 'any instances of text in content'. Thanks for the suggestion, nis@superlativ.dk.
bdc5a3eb51 Refs #3782 -- Added documentation note that suite() handling is only in development version.
9922a04bb6 Fixed #3782 -- Added support for the suite() method recommended by the Python unittest docs. Thanks for the suggestion, rene.puls@repro-mayr.de.
73bec372ee Fixed #4897 -- Fixed minor typo in doctest comment.
3fef1f4c8d Fixed #4558 -- Modified XML serializer to handle whitespace better around None tags. Thanks to Bill Fenner <fenner@gmail.com> for the report and fix.
0827f4ac7e Simplified the indent level in management.py _get_sql_model_create() by using a 'continue' statement rather than nesting everything in an 'if'
ac2b9f2a3f Added a db_type() method to the database Field class. This is a hook for calculating the database column type for a given Field. Also converted all management.py CREATE TABLE statements to use db_type(), which made that code cleaner. The Field.get_internal_type() hook still exists, but we should consider removing it at some point, because db_type() is more general. Also added docs -- the beginnings of docs on how to create custom database Field classes. This is backwards-compatible.
f5ef3bec68 Fixed #3925 -- Added Slovak localflavor items. Thanks, Martin Kosír.
9ff1060391 Fixed #4917 -- Updated Swedish translation. Thanks, Pilip Lindborg.

f6ced03321 Refs #3012 -- Removed iterator from `test_data_types` cache test that I added in [5703].  Iterators cannot be pickled either.  Left the rest of [5703] there though since it fixed another issue that was causing the `test_data_types` cache test to fail with the `locmem` cache backend, the fact that functions cannot be copied.
29891add3d Fixed #4887 -- Fixed another place where template tag arguments are used directly as function keyword args. Thanks, Brian Rosner.

50a3cea8b6 Fixed #4484 -- Fixed APPEND_SLASH handling to handle an empty path value. Thanks, VesselinK.

7a198f5105 Fixed #3770 -- Remove null=True tag from OneToOne serialization test. OneToOne fields can't have a value of null.
2d6d20def7 Fixed #4459 -- Added 'raw' argument to save method, to override any pre-save processing, and modified serializers to use a raw-save. This enables serialization of DateFields with auto_now/auto_now_add. Also modified serializers to invoke save() directly on the model baseclass, to avoid any (potentially order-dependent, data modifying) behavior in a custom save() method.
090aa5210e Improved syndication feed framework to use RequestSite if the sites framework is not installed -- i.e., the sites framework is no longer required to use the syndication feed framework. This is backwards incompatible if anybody has subclassed Feed and overridden __init__(), because the second parameter is now expected to be an HttpRequest object instead of request.path
dcd5750d7a Added RequestSite class to sites framework
06fc225ae6 Added helpful error message to SiteManager.get_current() if the user hasn't set SITE_ID

5a32b3ac2c Fixed #4798-- Made sure that function keyword arguments are strings (for the keywords themselves) when using Unicode URL patterns.
b6812f2d9d Fixed reverse URL lookup using functions when the original URL pattern was a string. This is now just as fragile as it was prior to [5609], but works in a few cases that people were relying on, apparently.
4c011e6f36 Corrected misleading comment from [5619]. Not sure what I was smoking at the time.
8c85ddf306 Fixed #4772 -- Fixed reverse URL creation to work with non-ASCII arguments. Also included a test for non-ASCII strings in URL patterns, although that already worked correctly.
fad7247715 Changed HttpRequest.path to be a Unicode object. It has already been URL-decoded by the time we see it anyway, so keeping it as a UTF-8 bytestring was causing unnecessary problems.
347704d2df Added some uncredited authors that worked on the Oracle branch.
3198b64516 Fixed #4776 -- Fixed a problem with handling of upload_to attributes. The new solution still works with non-ASCII filenames. Based on a patch from mike.j.thompson@gmail.com.

671fb8aa53 Fixed #4770 -- Fixed some Unicode conversion problems in the mysql_old backend with old MySQLdb versions. Tested against 1.2.0, 1.2.1 and 1.2.1p2 with only expected failures.

71cb907131 Fixed minor typo in assertion message.
05de381512 Fixed #1015 -- Fixed decorator_from_middleware to return a real decorator even when arguments are given. This looks a bit ugly, but it's fully backwards compatible and all the extra work is done at import time, so it shouldn't have any real performance impact.
79e914e496 Added CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_SECONDS to global settings and documentation (it's used by the cache middleware). Refs #1015.
d0b627acc2 Added a test that shows the problem in #4470. This fails only for the mysql_old backend. Refs #4470.

551a36131e Fixed #4693 -- Updated Japanese translation. Thanks, Makoto Tsuyuki.

17145eef4c Removed unneeded import.
a5802b35dd Fixed #4453 -- Allow dots in URL pattern names (although the string in that case is first tried as an import path and only then falls back to being treated as a pattern).

7ccf9978ad Added unit tests to fully check the performance of the serializer engines.
375c3edf6e Added various fixes to serializer implementations. Fixes mostly deal with handling nulls, non-integer primary key values (e.g., OneToOne fields or strings), and reconstruction of primary key references in related fields.
400ee02661 Added to_python implementation for NullBoolean Fields. This was required for the XML serializer.
e4e74f7e1d Modified expected output of one fixture doctest to make it non unix-specific.
9afc51bbcb Modified the internal dumpdata implementation to return the dumped data, rather than just printing to screen.
9f0c545add Added a YAML serializer built on PyYAML (http://pyyaml.org/). This serializer will only be enabled if PyYAML is installed, so I've not written any unit tests until I figure out how to make them work similarly. Still, the serializer is just a thin layer over the base Python serializer, and seems to Just Work.

6001974e45 newforms: Added initial implementation of form_for_model and form_for_fields
0a7d8b18ff newforms: Split the Form class into BaseForm and Form. The former has all the Form logic; the latter just implements the metaclass that allows for declarative form definition.

7e269bd390 Fixed #3107 -- newforms: Added Form.as_p()
44add112e5 newforms: Form.as_ul() no longer puts hidden fields between <li>s. Similar to [4175], which was the same thing for Form.as_table(). Refs #3101

72109f4e35 Added SessionMiddleware to MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES in global_settings, so it's available by default.

27986994ee Fixed #320 -- Changed save() code so that it doesn't rely on cursor.rowcount. MySQLdb sets cursor.rowcount to 0 in an UPDATE statement even if the record already exists. Now save() does a SELECT query to find out whether a record with the primary key already exists.
b5ed20434e Added unit test that tests #323 -- currently fails for MySQL and passes for PostgreSQL
db127b7983 Fixed #322 -- Development server now calls validate() again. Thanks, rmunn
91c71d36e6 Fixed #322 -- 'django-admin runserver' no longer validates models.
8f9e5b6b3b Added 'django-admin.py validate', which validates all installed models. Validation only handles common errors at this point, but we'll be improving it each time we think of a potential model syntax problem. Also changed the development Web server to validate automatically at server start.
4a7159865e Improved error handling for invalid model parameters that aren't custom functions.

bf108187a2 Fixed #321 -- Undid [494], which assumed the installed version of MySQLdb had a 'cursors.CursorNW'. Thanks for being consistent, MySQLdb. This opens #316 again.

54f93895a8 Added a quick example of prepopulate_from to clarify the description
b149fc3671 Fixed #310 -- thanks, mordaha
199aa88ffb Moved django.core.handlers.wsgi.AdminMediaHandler to django.core.servers.basehttp. Makes more sense to have it in there, because its only use is for the development server.
43f3b984e8 Removed <meta http-equiv='content-type'...> from admin base template, because Django sends out correct content-type HTTP header as of [340]
8d8da826db Changed timestamp and time typecasting to preserve microseconds. Added unit tests to test this behavior, and added a db_typecast unit test module. Refs #306.

46d8bbab3d Added help_doc to django.core.management.install
199938649e Fixed #81 -- Admin now supports primary_key=True for non-integer fields. Note that you'll have to make a change to your database if you're using a previous Django installation and want to use non-integer primary key fields. See the BackwardsIncompatibleChanges wiki page for info.
b3ae12fa4a Cleaned up admin view code to use new 'pk' lookup syntax
8e2d275390 Fixed #241 -- added django.contrib.markup app with markup templatetags for Textile, ReST and Markdown

3a1ae2164b Added a custom doctest OutputChecker that ignores differences between ints and longs in values returned from the database; refs #238
254f31819b Fixed #299 -- Slugify no longer removes hyphens. Thanks, gch@cs.cmu.edu

7bac552069 Changed [459] to use a better interface for the exception
024e68e260 Changed MySQL backend so that it fails silently if rollback() isn't supported (the code catches NotSupportedError exception)
0660203afe Added custom_pk unit tests, which fail because of #81
5b812ae02c Undid [455] -- it's not a good enough solution for what I'm trying to do
8a209c232c Fixed #296 -- Fixed typo in docs/model-api.txt. Thanks, rmunn
6d234fae8c Slightly refactored metasystem -- changed Field pre_save() hooks to pre_save_add(), in preparation for some bigger changes. Refs #81.
258e6bc330 Simplified metasystem get_db_prep_save() hook so that it doesn't take an 'add' parameter -- it wasn't being used, anyway.

9a6e8142b8 Removed media.ljworld.com reference from admin_media/js/admin/DateTimeShortcuts.js

b888113f49 Small change to docstring in django.core.template
217c746789 Copy-edited docs/templates.txt
32fe8e3863 Removed Janet Reno example from doc/templates.txt -- thanks, Bob
4f00611f74 Fixed #211 -- edit_inline_type is deprecated, in favor of edit_inline itself. For example, instead of 'edit_inline=True, edit_inline_type=meta.TABULAR', use 'edit_inline=meta.TABULAR'.
e79eb09f21 Fixed #293 -- Typo in tutorial04. Thanks, espen@grindhaug.org

9d8dd8610d Changed 'check back within 48 hours' message, because it's blatantly false -- apologies
a537a4efa1 Changed 'django-admin startapp' so that it doesn't create the 'urls' directory. People have said they're a bit overwhelmed by the multiple url directories, and this one isn't necessary for basic Django usage. You can always make it yourself if you know what you're doing and want to decouple/distribute your apps.
59c3ebc6dd Greatly improved the 404 error message when DEBUG=True. If none of the urlpatterns matches, Django now displays a list of all the urlpatterns it tried. This should catch a lot of newbie errors, and it's helpful even for power users.
c517960984 Made small cleanups to two default urlconfs, to be clearer.
b6a1105768 Updated admin doc view to reflect changes from [411]
a55598cbdd Refactored the internals of URL parsing to use less code
888cf1f889 Fixed #275 -- Bug in validators.RequiredIfOtherFieldsGiven. Thanks, jhernandez

2315ccc499 Fixed #268 -- Added AnyValidator and fixed small bug in [399]. Thanks, Hugo
dae5863058 Fixed #263 -- inspectdb output now includes a comment reminding people to run sqlinitialdata. Thanks, Hugo
a8ecb56106 Fixed #267 -- "Save and continue editing" no longer assumes object has an ID field. Thanks, Hugo
3f2df5e7aa Fixed #269 -- Added MatchesRegularExpression validator. Thanks, Hugo!

7dc07ed937 Fixed typo in one_to_one test docstring. Thanks, Frank

49c6708716 Added doc view for templates that will show the search path for a given template on each site
ce0d0cd9e2 Made a bunch of fixes to auto-generated admin documentation:
ffc3edd79e Fixed a subtle bug with the {% load %} tag: if a tag/filter was removed from template.registered_tags/filters, {% load %} would fail (since module-level code is only run on an initial import).  {% load %} now reloads the module, which makes sure that the tag always works even when someone's been doing something screwy.  This fixes #242 (and wouldn't had been found without it, so much thanks).
72e32b31f2 Fixed #249 -- Added our IRC nicks to docs/faq.txt. Good idea, espen
51aba5deaf Removed redundant verbose names from auth and core models, because they're no longer required
623863d0a4 Fixed #105 -- collapsable fieldsets now work in both ways (thanks, Simon)
b3b27d2593 Removed id field from auth.Message model -- it's implied
2e83364965 Calendar next/prev popups now work in Safari (fixed #2)
d9401b78f1 Added first stab at 'django-admin.py inspectdb', which takes a database name and introspects the tables, outputting a Django model. Works in PostgreSQL and MySQL. It's missing some niceties at the moment, such as detection of primary-keys and relationships, but it works. Refs #90.
1510ca1a80 Fixed #227 -- the sqlite backend now correctly typecasts unicode objects to bytestrings (thanks hugo)
e73c734336 Added 'Can I use Django with a pre-existing database?' to the FAQ

77faac0cb7 Changed SEND_BROKEN_LINK_EMAILS from True to False in global_settings -- it was causing too much confusion with improperly configured/missing mail servers
c73f4cd486 Removed tests/builddocs in favor of integrating it into the documentation builder for the site in general
