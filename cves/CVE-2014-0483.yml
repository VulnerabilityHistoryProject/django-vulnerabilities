yaml_instructions: |
  ===YAML Primer===
  This is a dictionary data structure, akin to JSON.
  Everything before a colon is a key, and the values here are usually strings
  For one-line strings, you can just use quotes after the colon
  For multi-line strings, as we do for our instructions, you put a | and then
  indent by two spaces
  For readability, we hard-wrap multi-line strings at 80 characters. This is
  not absolutely required, but appreciated.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.
  Rewrite this description IN YOUR OWN WORDS. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.
  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove project-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to this project would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
  Your target audience is people just like you before you took any course in
  security
description: |
  An attacker can use an input field on the site to create a relationship between model classes. 
  The classes involved don't originally have a relationship in the code which allows the attacker to view information.

  Please put the commit hash in "commit" below (see my example in
  CVE-2011-3092.yml). Fixes and VCCs follow the same format.
fixes:
- commit: 027bd348642007617518379f8b02546abacaa6e0
  note: |
   1.4
   This commit as well as the one below this updated exceptions 
   and even some whole new "try/Catch" statements. to handle the exception. 
   this was even described in a release document that was added in this commit
   They checked to see if they were allowed to access a field and then verified that the admin relationship does not exist
- commit: 2a446c896e7c814661fb9c4f212b071b2a7fa446
  note: |
   1.5
   Shares a lot of the same code that 1.4 but has a few additional fields moved around much more than 1.4
- commit: f7c494f2506250b8cb5923714360a3642ed63e0f
  note: |
   1.6
   A lot different from the previous two as the exceptions handed when you first look thing changed.
   They even have an options.py folder that checks
   There are official classes dedicated to invalid field inputs called "DisallowedModelAdminToField"
   that gets the related models to verify the relationship through different try catch blocks. Even in the main they have
   additional steps to verify the relationships
- commit: 2b31342cdf14fc20e07c43d258f1e7334ad664a6
  note: |
   1.7
   Similar to 1.6 although they remove a few ways where they set the "to_field" equal to a post in 1.7 but no mention of it in 1.6.
   They even add a whole new test to the admin_views to verify whether or not admins have control of things that are controlled or not.
vccs:
- commit: 732198ed5c2a127249970e0cd4218d093a38e9a2
  note: |
   This ticket does model comparing without the proper exception handling which technically both attempts a fix but doesnt prevent the issue from happenning in the long run.
- commit: b5f0aff922fe963a4df0d3449d8fe55a6acd950d
  note: |
   This fix corrects an issue where infinite migrations using certain arguments with a corrected search handling
- commit: ae7d9bfad2c92ebe30ce8ca0a145eba4504312f1
  note: |
   This added logging messages to the admin account. adding more information for the admin to see which relates to what the vulnerability reveals.
- commit: 3c51962cabc9537221b86c667aac5ffaa1469660
  note: |
   This was specific to 1.6. They updated tests for their options to retrieve permisions with the proper arguments.
- commit: d818e0c9b2b88276cc499974f9eee893170bf0a8
  note: |
   Added code from an outside project in 2013 (they start to write out the field handling before running into the problem)
- commit: 4ad1eb1c14b629cf5bcfd253ed40e875f1bddd47
  note: |
   Added validation to admin class
- commit: 75d2da797e100442d3573dfa7ae490972cea32d8
  note: |
   This fix was for 1.7. This fixed a few syntax errors, added to the admin view tests and aded a quote before redirecting from some of the admin functionality.
- commit: 390001ce52802a7fa1fceeabfb646e6b32911fb9
  note: |
   According to the description this was a logic fix but seems more of an organizing of code fix than a logic fix as they removed a huge chunk of the code from options and condensed it with simpler statements with the class that later had the vulnerability take place.
  note: |
   This was specific to 17.x. This was a small fix to a delayed detection
- commit: 5268d71f18d12c362d74010210309c1cec8e8a1a
  note: |
   This was specific to 17.x. This was an addition to some methods and to track for reports.
- commit: f51eab796d087439eedcb768cdd312517780940e
  note: |
   This was a fix to use a method instead of hard coding things

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?
    For code: and fix: - your answer should be boolean.
    For the code_answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix in related directories and determine if and was there were unit tests involved for this subsystem. The code
    For the fix_answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  code: true
  code_answer: Because there were tests in many of the git blames before the vulnerability was initially discovered in both related and unrelated sections.
  fix: true
  fix_answer: This was fixed because the github shows unit tests that check for that specific vulnerability in the fix hashes.
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?
    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.
    The automated, contest, and developer flags can be true, false, or nil.
    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then please explain where you looked.
  answer: |
   2014-08-14, I looked all over the git and the django website but no reaction nor any indication of how
   or when this vulnerability was found. They end off the description with "Thanks to Collin Anderson for reporting the Issue"
  automated: false
  contest: false
  developer: false
autodiscoverable:
  instructions: |
    Is it plausible that a fully automated tool could have discovered
    this? These are tools that require little knowledge of the domain,
     e.g. automatic static analysis, compiler warnings, fuzzers.
    Examples for true answers: SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflow
    Examples for false: RFC violations, permissions issues, anything
    that requires the tool to be "aware" of the project's
    domain-specific requirements.
    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  answer_note: It is plausible that a fuzzer could implement code and access certain data if the right injections were inserted correctly
  answer: true
specification:
  instructions: |
    Is there mention of a violation of a specification? For example,
    an RFC specification, a protocol specification, or a requirements
    specification.
    Be sure to check all artifacts for this: bug report, security
    advisory, commit message, etc.
    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  answer_note: Although its deduced that elevation of privilege is one of the things that came into mind. There is no mention of a specific violation of the examples provided in any of the commits aside from "Security Alert"
  answer: false
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?
    Most systems don't have a formal list of their subsystems, but you can
    usually infer them from path names, bug report tags, or other key words
    used. A single source file is not what we mean by a subsystem. In Django,
    the "Component" field on the bug report is useful. But there may be other
    subsystems involved.
    Your subsystem name(s) should not have any dots or slashes in them. Only
    alphanumerics, whitespace, _, - and @.Feel free to add multiple using a YAML
    array.
    In the answer field, explain where you saw these words.
    In the name field, a subsystem name (or an array of names)
    e.g. clipboard, model, view, controller, mod_dav, ui, authentication
  answer: django/contrib/admin/options.py
  name: admin
interesting_commits:
  question: |
   Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?
   Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
   interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
   emerging themes?
  commits:
  - commit: 2a446c896e7c814661fb9c4f212b071b2a7fa446
    note: |
     This is interesting because of how much similar it is to 1.4 but does things in a slightly more condenced manner such as reducing a response statement so its not the username thats tested but the id
  - commit: d228c1192ed59ab0114d9eba82ac99df611652d2
    note: |
     This was hilarious because of "Suspicious activity" being monitored by weird naming conventions and a lot of "suspicious"-like logic to monitor it all.
i18n:
  question: |
   Was the feature impacted by this vulnerability about internationalization
   (i18n)? An internationalization feature is one that enables people from all
   over the world to use the system. This includes translations, locales,
   typography, unicode, or various other features.
   Answer should be boolean. Write a note about how you came to the conclusions
   you did.
  answer: false
  note: |
   "There was nothing featuring internationalization in such"
ipc:
  question: |
   Did the feature that this vulnerability affected use inter-process
   communication? IPC includes OS signals, pipes, stdin/stdout, message
   passing, and clipboard. Writing to files that another program in this
   software system reads is another form of IPC.
   Answer should be boolean.
  answer: false
  note: |
   "There was nothing discussing such in this"
lessons:
  question: |
   Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
   vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
   of one of those lessons?
   Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
   not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
   a quick explanation of how it applies.
   Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
   that one or two of them apply.
   If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
   free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
   In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
   led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
   Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?
   Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
   they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?
   Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
   every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
   engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
   There was a few design mistakes with different aspects of the code as well as a lot of code miscommunication between each version
   For instance 1.6 and 1.7 were very condenced in terms of classes and had the same vulnerability but 1.4 and 1.5 had the vulnerability and was a mess altogether, making the vulnerability more exploitable and tougher to fix.
   To also add, communication was also not their strong suit because 90% of the vccs found didnt even indicate nor show anything about which version of this code is being worked on which was very fustrating to follow.
CWE_instructions: |
 Please go to http://cwe.mitre.org and find the most specific, appropriate CWE
 entry that describes your vulnerability. We recommend going to
 https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/699.html for the Software Development
 view of the vulnerabilities. We also recommend the tool
 http://www.cwevis.org/viz to help see how the classifications work.
 If you have anything to note about why you classified it this way, write
 something in CWE_note. This field is optional.
 Just the number here is fine. No need for name or CWE prefix. If more than one
 apply here, then choose the best one and mention the others in CWE_note.
CWE: 280
CWE_note: | 
 As attackers seek out the relationship mishandling when a relationship cannot be found, 
 they take that opening and use it to exploit the system and use the sensitive data to their liking 
nickname_instructions: |
 A catchy name for this vulnerability that would draw attention it. If the
 report mentions a nickname, use that. Must be under 30 characters.
 Optional.
nickname: Link from the underworld
