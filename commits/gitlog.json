CsrfViewMiddleware to\n   the default value of MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES.\n * protecting all contrib apps (whatever is in settings.py)\n   using a decorator.\n\nFor existing users of the CSRF functionality, it should be a seamless update,\nbut please note that it includes DEPRECATION of features in Django 1.1,\nand there are upgrade steps which are detailed in the docs.\n\nMany thanks to 'Glenn' and 'bthomas', who did a lot of the thinking and work\non the patch, and to lots of other people including Simon Willison and\nRussell Keith-Magee who refined the ideas.\n\nDetails of the rationale for

A huge thanks to Jacob Burch for the work on the PyLibMC backend, and to Jannis for his work on the cache definition changes.\n\ngit-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@15005 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37","insertions":252,"deletions":744,"filepaths":{"django/conf/global_settings.py":{"insertions":3,"deletions":4},"django/contrib/gis/db/backends/spatialite/creation.py":{"insertions":5,"deletions":8},"django/core/cache/__init__.py":{"insertions":26,"deletions":102},"django/core/cache/backends/base.py":{"insertions":9,"deletions":28},"django/core/cache/backends/db.py":{"insertions":4,"deletions":8},"django/core/cache/backends/dummy.py":{"insertions":1,"deletions":5},"django/core/cache/backends/filebased.py":{"insertions":3,"deletions":7},"django/core/cache/backends/locmem.py":{"insertions":6,"deletions":17},"django/core/cache/backends/memcached.py":{"insertions":26,"deletions":91},"django/db/backends/creation.py":{"insertions":6,"deletions":8},"django/middleware/cache.py":{"insertions":8,"deletions":29},"django/views/decorators/cache.py":{"insertions":6,"deletions":7},"docs/internals/contributing.txt":{"insertions":1,"deletions":1},"docs/ref/settings.txt":{"insertions":25,"deletions":125},"docs/releases/1.3.txt":{"insertions":4,"deletions":23},"docs/topics/cache.txt":{"insertions":73,"deletions":212},"tests/regressiontests/cache/liberal_backend.py":{"insertions":2,"deletions":2},"tests/regressiontests/cache/tests.py":{"insertions":40,"deletions":67},"tests/regressiontests/templates/tests.py":{"insertions":4,"deletions":0}}},"d0eb4693ab479ef0667cd5286ecc89c347b6b2de":{"author":"Aymeric Augustin","email":"aymeric.augustin@m4x.org","date":"2011-11-19 19:56:31 UTC","message":"Fixed #15255 -- Ensured createcachetable honors database routers.\n\n\ngit-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@17114 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37","insertions":10,"deletions":49,"filepaths":{"django/contrib/gis/db/backends/spatialite/creation.py":{"insertions":3,"deletions":1},"django/core/management/commands/createcachetable.py":{"insertions":4,"deletions":8},"django/db/backends/creation.py":{"insertions":3,"deletions":1},"tests/regressiontests/cache/tests.py":{"insertions":0,"deletions":39}}},"f6c991667f6f1ab8d2fd2afc1ee2b5801e78b7e3":{"author":"Jannis Leidel","email":"jannis@leidel.info","date":"2011-03-02 12:47:36 UTC","message":"Fixed #4992 -- Respect the GET request query string when creating cache keys.
